138255165,1159690,"A Raft style survival where you basically bring your base along with you. I will be making a lot of comparisons to Raft as that really is the gold standard currently for this style of survival.

Resource gathering is a chore and every single item you only get one of. You have to ""swim"" to each item to collect it for a very long time until you get the hookshot which only really extends like, 10 feet. Compared to Raft where you start with the hook, resources might come within reach of the boat, and there's ""bonus"" barrels containing lots of resources. Voidtrain has ""stops"" along the way with some crates that might drop like 1-3 items, but not a lot. Speaking of which, enemies are at these stops and if you die you lose all inventory items. Why? Where the fuck did it go? I guess the void in voidtrain is a big more accurate for items. Should call this void items.

The items are very annoying to handle, fuel is a constant need and when you only get one log every so often you are just sitting around waiting. There's a lot of crap to carry around too and not a lot of storage. The only chest you get for a while has only four slots. FOUR! Even raft gave you eight for the basic cooler, and then it wasn't long after that you got the bigger chest.

The UI and crafting is terrible, everything you use has a 1 second animation where the UI is brought up and you have to wait. One second you might ask? Who would complain about such a thing? Try out Raft and then want to craft something that requires multiple parts. You'll need to access your storage crates, access your crafting menu, and refuel the furnaces for what you need. It's all seemless, no animations to load it up all fancy, usually requires a simple press of the e to access or refuel. Void Train makes it all more complicated. E to access storage, wait, grab items, exit window. E to access station, wait, choose a fuel, choose an item category, choose a item to craft, click craft, exit out of four windows.

I wish I could say the scenery was good at least. In the distance it's kind of neat, but everything immediately around the train is the same shit, asteroids and wreckage.

I recommend people avoid. It's not as fun as you might think.",0

I like the game thus far a lot. The aesthetics and atmosphere are phenomenal. It does play somewhat different compared to the first part though but not in a negative way. You do not have to constantly worry about your lvl6 hero dying. Plays much more like a ususal roguelike now.

138127647,1159690,"This is a review of Voidtrain playing as a Solo who has gone in absolutely blind


I saw this game on sale, so I grabbed it. Seemed like a fun concept.

I'm pleasantly surprised. It is a rather fun game to vibe out to, however there a few things that I feel can be improved on, but that's to be expected from an Early Access Game.

Its got a really really unique world. It makes me think of the hollow Earth Theory. However, I think this is kind of what harms the game. Again, this may be fleshed out in the updates, I feel like this game is about a mile long, but an inch deep. They have a very unique setting, a very unique idea, and I feel like there needs to be a bit more emphasis put into deepening the environment.

The pacing can be a bit strange for some who are used to games like Rust. You go through the void on your train, grab resources to build up your armory on your train, then go out and shoot dudes at various stations the train stops at (which, again, need some variation, but early access). It may seem mundane, but compare it to something like Rust where you can hit a point where you just sorta find yourself not really wanting to do much else after collecting goods, building a giant house, and getting more resources than you can possibly know what to do with. There seems to be always something to be working on in this game. Im about 8-ish hours in, and I still feel like I am not established, which I find great. You never feel like ""Wow, what the heck am I gonna do with all this material"". You are always going to be needed to grab material from the void.

And that's where it may be a bit of a division among people. The resource gathering is interesting. You are tied to your train, you venture out and physically grab items. Or you use a short range grappling gun to get the resources. That's the main source of resource gathering. You cannot seek out and grab exactly what you need, however there is a way to influence how the void supplies the materials (which is introduced a bit later than I feel it should be).

Combat is serviceable. Its nothing groundbreaking. You go to a station, 10 or so dudes roll out, you shoot them, and move on. The game has mechanics to build your own gun using prefab parts and it feels like there is a ton of depth that can be added here, but the combat just feels too generic for me to really bother. I only really found myself optimizing my guns like once, and I LOVE customizing guns as much as possible in games. The combat feels like it's missing some weight to it. It feels like I'm just popping guys in a moving shooting gallery. As far as AI goes, they do tend to try to use cover and flank, so I don't think it's too bad on that front.     

I believe that this game has potential. I am enjoying it more than Raft (A comparison I see a lot). It obviously has the issues that an early access game would have (hitboxes to pick up items being really annoying, the enemies on the void just getting stuck on the train, not a ton of variety in environment), but I think as it develops, it'll come into something great.",1
138128055,1730250,"As others have said it's a lot like Dorfromantik, however that one was a little too hard for me personally and I've been wanting a game exactly like this for months. So if you're also looking for something in the same style but more casual then this game is awesome. I love the animals hidden around too, it's such a cute little cherry on top. I haven't quite complete it yet but I think there's a lot of replay-ability here even once you do, and of course creative mode if you like that type of thing. Overall really fun to pick up for a couple hours when you need a break from whatever.",1
138127323,2167550,"I was lucky enough to have a friend in the Adult World Gamers Group to send me a copy of this game, first all I wanted to give him a shout out for doing so.  It was very nice.   And from this quick review I am going to make after just over 2 hours played I think I can very safely so that this is a great game for those people like myself that enjoy games in the vein of Slay the Spire.

This is an initial run review.  I will as usual try to come back and update the game after I have more hours invested.

First off the quick blurb about the game is it follows pretty much the same general game play as Slay the Spire and other similar games that came after StS.  In this case it is most likely my favorite StS clone.   If you don't know how StS works, I will tell you from the viewpoint of Creeping Deck.

You have a map that runs up a vertical ladder of sorts.  You can at certain points change the direction of the way up the map you are going, but usually it is best to look at the map to see what all you want.  Do you feel brave and want to try to fight you way mostly to the top to reach the current Temple (level's) Big Bad or do you want to plot a way that gives you more treasure or maybe more places to rest.   Pretty much the same way you do in StS, but Creeping Deck offers a map with more routes to choose from.

As you progress you will earn different types of currency, gold, a type of shards and one other type I can't recall what it is called.  As you progress you will earn these currencies, though depending on the rate you may earn more or less.  Along the way you will often be at a crossroads where you have to make a choice if you want to trade gold for a new artifact or potion, or if you want to loose a card to do so.   The part in this is you will not know exactly what artifact you are getting though if you choose to trade a card for it, you do have the choice of what card to use to trade for the artifact.

Of course if you hit a treasure spot you may just get a chest with x amount of currency inside.  Depending the route you go you may have more or only one campfire stop (rest stop)  I can't recall the name in the game, but this is like StS where you can rest to restore a bit of lost XP, or if you have unlocked via progression you can boost cards or get new artifacts (I believe that is true on the artifacts but I haven't unlocked that yet).

Like StS you start off with a choice at the start of each temple, it might be to have X amount of shields or health that you can pick from for example.  This will work for good or bad synergy wise as I found out in my run tonight.  Example, I had an artifact that gives you a shield when you used a skill (skills are what you pick at the start of the run, could be like in this case that I had a skill to heal for 2 action points, one of the artifacts that I had would give me a slight shield when I used said skill.

I had little trouble beating the first boss as the game is straight forward, but going to the next temple I got in a bind that I could due to my artifact selection.   In this particular case the mob I was up against would curse you (similar to StS) where cards become wasted cards, luckily in this case they didn't do me direct damage but they had fade that meant when I used them they go to a discard pile, not to be pulled from again.  The particular mob I was dealing with not only was turning two of my cards to be unusable pretty much every turn but every few turns it would cast a heal on itself.   Now this most likely wouldn't have been as big of problem, but I had an artifact that gives you a 50% change for a ""fade"" card not to be discarded.  So I had a shield and heal where the mob couldn't do any direct damage that I couldn't out heal, but was slowly turning my deck into a waste.   

Luckily I got an upper hand as I finally ran into a number of cards that hadn't been flipped on me, and was able to barely get the mob killed before I was completely out of cards that where usable.   I didn't run into that but I assume once that happens and your deck is completely in the discard (fade pile) that it's game over.   If that's not the case I would have been stuck just healing and in a endless loop.

After you beat a temple's boss you go to a village where you can use your various currencies to buy artifacts, skill boost, and other progression abilities and tools like unlocking more a larger health pool, unlock the ability to forge cards when at a rest stop and so on.   This  is a bit more interesting in my option that StS's way of progression because there are a lot of things to choose from and like I said you want to synergize your artifacts along with your skill in the best possible manner.

At that point once you are done, you can progress to the next temple.   With that you face more mobs, treasures and chances for currency to use as well.

I have yet to try the game on my Steam Deck, so I can't comment on if it is playable yet or not on the deck.  I don't see any reason it wouldn't be until I try I am just guessing that it should work.   It worked flawlessly on my desktop rig.

Before I go into the Pros/Cons I like to give a quick rundown of the system I played on.  I played on an i5-7400 @ 3Ghz, 16GB Ram, Solid State Drive and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060.   So by no means a top of the line system anymore, but as I said it ran flawless.  Zero CTD (Crash to Desktops) or any other issues I could see.  The game is a bit more graphically intensive problem than StS due to the quality of textures for the mobs, but since the game is a Turn-Based game, you are not really going to be too concerned with the FPS.  I never had anything remotely that appeared to be a lockup or freeze.

So now the Pros/Cons:

Pros:
1) The game is stable already this soon into Early Access.  Balancing seems to be good as I had some rough but fair fights.  Yes I did have the one battle that took longer than I wanted but it was not the fault of the game design, but me not being prepared for the type of battle I ran into and having a complete wrong set of artifacts to compensate. 

2) If you have played games similar to Slay the Spire, you will feel right at home.  As mentioned there are a few difference here and there but the general flow are the same.  However Creeping Deck has more route options and seems to have a much more in depth progression system.

3) While I was lucky enough to have a friend purchase the game for me, I can easily say that I wouldn't have a moment's question about the asking price based on what I found playing the game.  It is a perfect price point for a game that is very re-playable.

Cons:
1)  Not a Con really, but if you don't like playing games with too similar of game loop, then I would say if you don't have Slay the Spire already it be a bit hard to know which to buy.  StS has years under it's belt and Creeping Deck is fresh into Early Access.  Personally though like I said, I feel that they are both unique enough from each other to make owing both a idea situation.

2) As mentioned it is easy to pick a wrong synergy between skills and trinkets but that is part of the fun as well.   The ability to experiment the best load out is a strong suit in my case, but others might not like that it is in true Roguelite fashion a game that can and will let you set yourself up to fail if you are not careful or get greedy.   Of course for most people like me this is a strong point, but I know a good deal of people don't like to run into a ""Kobayashi Maru"" or for you non-treckies out there, a no-win situation no matter how well you play.  This isn't a game where skill will always save you.

138279273,2128270,"Fun game.  Even though it is early access it is stable and has a lot of skills to play around with and enemies to defeat.  

The game's unique feature is that you don't 'cast spells' but rather spells/skills are effects that are triggered by attacking, moving or standing still.  It works surprisingly well and keeps the game simple and fast-paced.  Be sure to check out the 'guide' section when you first start playing to understand the triggers.

Each game is quite quick and a full run can be completed within an hour.  The user interface is well done with text colouring and information on hovering.  The graphics are simple with pixel art but coloured well and clear.  The sounds and music are limited but it does have a catchy little tune that plays in the background.

Damage can be very spiky, especially on the higher difficulty levels - sometimes something will do 20 damage, then next turn will do 120 damage.  If you don't have much resistance to a particular element and you don't manage to dodge then you'll die quickly.  It can be hard getting resistances up for everything.

I'm looking forward to seeing how the game progresses throughout early access.",1
138250834,2369390,"I cannot recommend this game for purchase because I did not like it for the following reasons:
1. An empty, lifeless world, it is extremely uninteresting to explore it.
2. Idiot gameplay decisions, in the form of an uncomfortable viewing angle of 51, when driving, swimming, and other actions. Lack of normal saves, but only autosave, which does not always save the process. It’s even easier not to use transport at all, but to assemble a parkour set and run at the speed of transport. Annoying helicopter bosses.
3. Idiots are the main characters, for example, a black man who almost undermined the main character, a psychopath man, an alcoholic man, a cuckold man, all the men in this game are some kind of inferior morons, and only women are strong and independent.
4. A bunch of paid DLS that should have been free. I think it's bad manners to sell a suit for money.
5. The women in this game look and act like men. The game takes place on a tropical island, but there is not even a fuскing swimsuit for the main character to take pictures of her in photo mode, it's very sad.

Я не могу порекомедовать эту игру к покупке потому-что она мне не понравилась по следующим причинам:
1. Пустой, безжизненный мир, исследовать его крайне не интересно.
2. Идиoтские геймпленые решения, в виде некомфортного угла обзора 51, при езде, плавании, и прочих действия. Отсутвие нормальных сохранений, а только автосохранение, которе не всегда сохраняет процесс. Еще проще вообще не пользоваться транспортом, а собрать сет паркура, и бегать на скорости транспорта. Назойливые боссы вертолеты. 
3. Идиoты главные герои, например негр котрый четь не подорвал главного героя, психопат мужик, алкаш мужик, куколд мужик, все мужчины в этой игре какие-то неполноценные дебилы, и только женщины сильные и независимые. 
4. Куча платного ДЛС, котрый должен был быть бесплатным. Считаю что это моветон продавать костюм за деньги.
5. Женщины в этой игре выглядят и ведут себя как мужики. Игра происходит на тропическом острове, но тут даже нет сраного купальника для главной героини, чтобы можно было ее пофотографировать в фоторежиме, это очень грустно.",0

For 15 euros, I really don't have a problem with it. The game runs well and you can have a lot of fun. 

Graphics - TAA sucks, the game looks very blurry. Don't even turn on FSR 1.0. Raytracing is useless in every game for me, it just eats up FPS. 

The environment of Cuba is really nice. This game is the actual representation of our Culture. NPCs screaming “pinga” or “asere” let’s you know that Ubisoft really invested time investigating the culture and the little details of our nation. Also the buildings, the country side, the vehicles, the characters. 

You can do the missions your way, like take a tank and destroy everything or go stealthy.  It's fun 

The story at the beginning is good, but then it gets pretty bad/uninteresting. Just skip something here and there 

For three 15 euro ( basic version ) it's good, but I wouldn't give full price for it. Basically the gameplay hasn't changed much. Just maybe the skills have been washed away

138351656,1383370,"Welcome to The Poor Man's Witcher 3!

I joke but you'll immediately see the similarities between the two games. Go into the menu options alone and you'll see it. All the way down to eating food when fighting to heal yourself to battle random trolls who like to cause mischief. So that was a bit distracting as I was playing because this game is no where near as good as Witcher 2 or 3 and yet they are charging the same price as Witcher 2. 20 dollars.

So that's also a bit distracting. Since I kept getting reminded at every turn about Witcher 3 all it did was make me feel like I was playing a crappy game.

But the truth is, this game is painfully average. It doesn't do anything very well but it doesn't really fail either. As an Early Access game its about what I expected. But normally I can get through all of that as long as the story or gameplay is solid. 
Here, the gameplay is awkward and the story is boring and bland. The only thing unique about this game is its tribalistic setting.

I don't wanna give it a thumbs down because technically it's not awful. And since there is no neutral button I'll give it a thumbs up. It never crashed, it never broke or froze on me. It has plenty of content and it operates well enough.

Just know going into this game that it clearly needs a lot of work. The gameplay needs to be more fluid, the sound effects need to be adjusted, they desperately need to add more voice actors to their roster and they need to get that lighting down. At times it looks great and at others it's nearly blinding me. Also maybe add some bolder lines separating things because a lot of things were blending together making it hard to make certain things out. Add some hit detection during combat, add some more combat mechanics like making it possible to hit enemies even if they're not targeted, get rid of that framerate dropping and you'll actually be a decent enough game. But that story was boring, the writing sub-par and overall the gameplay and the journey I just went on was very average and not very interesting.

DD2 is a great, the game feels like I’m trying to open the hellraiser cube with my tendrils. It brings a fresh new playstyle, with new mechanics, travel style and new enemies. It may be a sadistic cruel game, but to me that’s what makes it fun. 

Modern games are generally two easy you get shot, you hide and suck your thumb and your all better. Not DD2, you make a mistake; you used the wrong skill, you chose a wrong route, you don’t use recon on your enemies (middle mouse button BTW) or myriad of possible missteps you die. I like a game which is challenge and if you do too, you will love DD2.

138274214,855740,"Overall don't get this game unless it's on sale and you want to have some fun with ragdoll physics & a few other gimmicks. In my opinion the comedy isn't always there, and it feels strained after the first hour. Surprisingly didn't run into any bugs (other than maybe getting stuck for a moment on some geometry) in my 10 hours, really well done in that regard.

Gameplay-wise it's floaty/arcadey, the loop is simple yet fun, quests/missions are VERY simple.

Inventory management can be a nightmare, & Carl (an all AI) likes to get stuck, he can't fit through certain doors.

I HATE the reptilian eyes everyone has (its because the face has an indent for the eyes, and the eyes are just flat textures).

Unskippable dialog/cutscenes should be a sin in modern gaming. If you fail a mission you have to watch the entire cutscene again.

138248023,1159690,"I like the concept of Voidtrain, but as of the date of this review (May 5, 2023) I cannot recommend it.

I've played the game for a little over 5 hours and from what I've seen the game offers little variety and becomes boring quite quickly.

I'll do my best to give you an idea of the gameplay I've experienced so far:

You spend most of your time riding a train on a straight track through the ""Void"" while collecting resources floating in space near the track.  There is zero gravity in the environment except on and above the train platform (and within  the Train Stations you encounter along the way).  You are tethered to the train and can only venture out so far.  While riding the train, you may also encounter various Void creatures.  Some of them are harmless and provide a source of food.  Others will attack you or the train.  You can fight back using weapons you acquire during your travels.  You can also build various crafting stations on the train that allow you to craft items and resources, research new technology, and fortify the train.

Every so often, the train stops at a station where you can find resources, fight enemies, upgrade your train, and find clues about the world and story.

Gameplay so far has been driven by on-screen prompts to research and build the next level of technology and narrated events.  It's all very linear with little opportunity to make any decisions about how to progress.

The Train Stations have offered little variety so far.  I've encountered a handful so far and the layouts are mostly the same with a few minor variations.  There is a definite feeling of deja vu at each stop.

I know the game offers more than I've seen so far, but it's not interesting enough for me to want to continue - at least for now.

Overall the game just feels very basic and lacks excitement.  There needs to be a better sense of freedom and exploration.  I'm not sure how the developers could add that since the game is literally and figuratively ""on rails"".

My advice to the developers would be to add more variety to the outposts and add more things to do while travelling on the train.  Perhaps there is already more to it than I've seen, but  if there is it needs to be introduced earlier to maintain the player's interest.  I'd also shift the focus from simply telling players what to do next to letting them discover it on their own.  I read that there were plans to optionally disable the narrator and I think I'd also like to see the option to disable the ""quests"" that prompt you to build the next level of tech.  I'd like to feel like I have some level of control on how to progress rather than feeling like the game is just a series of checking off boxes.

I think the game is priced far too high.  I've gotten far more enjoyment and play time out of less expensive games like Valheim or 7 Days to Die.

Lastly, I've seen some criticism of other negative reviews.  A lot of people seem to believe that you shouldn't criticize an ""Early Access"" game.  However my review speaks to my feelings about the current state of the game and whether I'd recommend it right now.  I do plan on revisiting it again if there are more content updates but for now I'm moving on to other games.  I think it's a good concept but it needs to be fleshed out a bit more before it's worthy of my time.",0

138274356,1742020,Better then Tekken,1
138274275,2272970,"For only $5, what this game brings to the table is incredible. 

What the game does well, it does very well. The spritework is amazing, down to the subtle little details, like Gera squinting when their bright torch is illuminated right in their face, or their face showing shock at the sheer recoil of the shotgun when it fires. 

While the game is very punishing, and you can expect to die time and time again, never did I feel 'cheated,' be it by the physics or the enemies. Checkpoints are spaced out juuuuust enough for it to not feel like a walk in the park, but also it doesn't also deflate you when you die right before hitting one, as you are sent no more than 3 minutes back as a consequence.
 
The sound design works well to contribute a different feel to all three areas, especially considering there is only so much visual variation you can achieve with black and white.

The small IV drips of lore in the form of the notes really provide an emphasis to go out and explore. While not a super 'deep' story by any means, I really wanted to find out more about the fate of the other fellows that got trapped in this hole.

Some of the game's horror elements are also really well done. The exploding insect egg things made me jump in my seat a bit the first couple times they went off. The tension in area 2, as you swim closer to the big fish's lair is also very palpable, and it made me really dread descending deeper into the water.

HOWEVER, this game does have some very apparent shortcomings at the moment. Bear in mind that I have not gone for a true ending run, and I have been informed that the feel of the second and third areas are altered under these circumstances. My criticisms are based on my two very casual runthroughs of the game.

Firstly, it is VERY cryptic. I had to scour other reviews and patch notes in order to scrounge enough information to figure out what I had to do. 

Even then, getting a satisfactory ending in any short amount of time is impossible, as the true ending requires you to beat the game without dying. Considering I died no less than 50 times during a normal playthrough, seeing how it's really supposed to pan out seems like a pipe dream. 

There is also an extreme lack of any visually-distinct landmarks, which requires you to memorize the path to the next area in its entirety, which adds a lot of needlessly getting lost into the mix. 

The gun is also a hassle to fire, requiring a 3-button combo to get a shot off. This means it is almost impossible to fire on a whim, causing you to stand there, gun readied, waiting for any creature to find you. If you try to find them, by the time they pop into your tiny field of view, it is too late to take out, shoulder, and fire your gun.

The audio, while good in some respects, still sounds incredibly stock in others. Some sounds, like the really crunchy torch, serve to break my immersion every so often. I also know that a big motif of this game is insanity, but the use of the Shepard tone in one of the areas drove me insane for all the wrong reasons. I will fully admit that's a nitpick, though.

Finally, it's a bit unfortunate that many of the game's horror elements only really have a first-time impact. I understand that desensitization is a thing. After 1000 jumpscares, FNAF isn't really poop-your-pants scary. Nevertheless, I found myself becoming very at ease in these different environs as soon as my first death in them. There is very little in the way of tension build up through audio, and the only thing that works to keep you hesitant is the very low range of visibility. There is also generally only one enemy type per zone, which means you know exactly how they're going to behave as early as your second encounter. Given that a foundational principle of horror is uncertainty, this does not do much to keep the player on edge.

While it looks like I had more mean things to say than kind ones, I cannot stress enough how much fun I had playing this game. It's short, sweet, and infinitely replayable. Please spend $5 to support this developer. It is well worth it!

138127271,1940340,"So yes, DD II is here. Wasn't really worth the wait.

It's not a bad game, actually, but i'd say it is sliiightly worse than DD I.
And it's not really a sequel, it's a completely different game.

Pros:
1) Beautiful. Also, hi Wayne!
2) Different story, can't wait to see it through the end.
3) A lot of new mechanics and improved old ones.
4) DD II now has room for proper planning and tactics, every action has more weight.
5) Game communicates to player way better than DD I did.
6) Meta progression - losses are less impactful.

Cons:
1) Random has become even worse. Before it could decide a battle; now it kills the run every time game decides it's time for you to lose - see also pro 4. 
2) Relation system is heavily weighted towards hindering your progress rather helping it, and there is no meaningful way to mitigate it - the inns can't compete with the impact RNG has on your arguing heroes.
3) Stress management is gone, apparently - although it can be meta lock problem.
4) All bosses are apparently has became a dps check before they go in stunlock mode, which kind of kills the variety.
5) The player now has significantly less control over the gameplay overall - see also pro 4. Might just be skill issue.
6) Meta progression - standard ""pour 100 hours in before you get to access the game"". Wins are much less revarding. 
7) Again, might be connected to con 6 - but the difficulty curve feels more like a difficulty cliff. Beat the Denial on the very first attempt (by pure luck, no doubt), and now I can't even reach the boss 75% of the time.  
8) Travel part gameplay has became a waiting game. Simply waiting, doing nothing, watching as heroes randomly gouging each other's eyes for no reason. Stressing at first, boring later.

If you have played DD I and liked it, this probably will be a disappointment.

Upgrade trees so far don't offer anything super unique but the options that are there all have legitimate use cases so at least the upgrades aren't diluted by anything useless.

Things I'd like to see:
- More options for controlling the radius of the barrier, a 123 hotkey version that flicks instant between max, medium and a very small but still active barrier would be great for more accurate play 
- Having no effect on the eggs except popping them is kinda disappointing, I'd love to see some upgrades that make the eggs you pop grow back slower eg. freeze/cryo
- Explosion radius from mortars imho should pop eggs within radius but instakill anything hatching
- Some kind of very rare player activated power would be amazing, it could build up from kills and just use the 'swarm' event trigger but don't have the enemies hatch (maybe it leaves enemy eggs unhatched and just pops the harmless eggs)",1

[h1]Not perfect but the best you can get[/h1]
The Isle of Man Tourist Trophy is about the craziest race there is. The game does a great job giving you that experience as player.

Performance is sadly not as perfect as I wish. The engine is outdated, doesn't support DLSS or FSR and despite delivering 90-130 FPS there's always a slight stutter at some point. Not game-breaking bad, but still noticable.

Still they make the best they can with it. The landscape is very varied and the studio did a great job making it not feel like a complete copy & paste job. 

There are plenty of options to lower difficulty to a beginner friendly level. If you're unfamiliar with bike racing a few tips:
[list]
[*]Use beginner physics, they are far more forgiving than realistic ones
[*]Start a career in Supersport, the bikes have less power and topspeed and are slightly more nimble
[*]Play in exterior view. While 1st person is awesome and thrilling, it's the worst to learn the course and bike behavior
[*]Lean into curves early, not when you just reach it
[*]At beginner level you can break later than indicated, maybe 0.5-0.75s when entering the ""red zone""
[*]Change controller sensitivity: custom control layout, sensitivity 5 (default -5) and deadzone 1 (default 10)
[*]Play it safe till you know the course, not crashing saves you far more time, than taking a curve on the very edge of performance
[*]If you leave track (curbsides, gravel, sand, grass), don't break and don't accelerate. Carefully try to get back to track, that's your best bet not to crash.
[/list]

[h1]Positives:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Varied landscape and courses
[*]great physics
[*]incredible speed sensation (especially in 1st person view)
[*]great variation of drivers and bikes
[*]great difficulty options
[*]high long time value 
[*]Time restricted challenges apart from online championship: measure your skill with others outside of a race by beating their times
[/list]

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
[*]No DLSS/FSR support, no stable FPS. Not as smooth as I expect of a racing game (e.g. Forza Horizons or Grid). Even at low settings I get occasional micro stutter
[*]Upgrade system is kinda stupid: you upgrade parts, and your opponents do so along. In the end, it just increases general performance and difficulty for you ;)
[*]Carreer qualify/race system is stupid: you do a qualify time one part of a track, only to do a race one a different one afterwards. Where's the point in that?

[h1]Final thoughts[/h1]
Ride, Rims, TT Isle of Man... Why the few superbike games on the market can't deliver a smooth racing experience? The last  one I personally recall is the ancient Superbike World Championship by EA (1999). TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3 still is a great gaming experience and racing those high power machines through towns and country roads is awesome fun. The learning curve for beginners might be high, but there's enough of options to give you a fighting chance.",1

Now the not so good to terrible. Desync all the things anytime you play multiplayer, typically once per battle, never on campaign map except over end turns. This game is horribly optimized, it doesn't feature a standard resolution option like every other, so if you have a 4k monitor the game just runs in 4k, and so on. There are work arounds but they have to be reapplied every single time you play. Enemies will field far more stacks then you easily, despite smaller cities and resource pools. Their heroes rank up much faster even while abstaining from combat, (some level 11 when yours are 3-4 despite fighting every turn). Be prepared for some very unfavorable engagements even on normal difficulty.

Now the worst, really hoping this gets remedied asap. EVERY SINGLE TIME the game or ANY mod you are using gets updated, ALL of your multiplayer sessions will fail to load indefinitely. You cannot force the game to load and update the mods like it would in other titles, you cannot revert the mods back to previous versions of themselves to resume, you cannot force steam to simply never update worship content unless you are unplugged and cannot do multiplayer without a LAN cable. So basically you can play vanilla, or you can play single player with mods, but you can't do multiplayer with mods at least during this time.

Absolutely adored AOW3, multiplayer didn't suffer from any of these issues, hoping #4 can get there. This game has utter loads of potential, but if you were like me and paid for the premium and all potential DLC, had a bunch of mates do the same only to find out they can't play together the way they want, well upsetting is an understatement.",0

138249794,1277920,"This is a INDIE mmorpg created by FOUR developers. If you are isntalling expecting WOW or another huge MMORPG.. than this is not the game for you. If you are looking for a new adventure, with old school elements and no hand holding, you will love this game. There is ton to do, with around TWENTY CLASSES. The player base is slowly growing. This game has many negative reviews due to the server issues and accidental double charge (WHICH THEY HAVE REFUNDED). This is a beautiful mmo that can resemble other old school games. Hats off to the four developers.",1

Español:
No e jugado el juego siquiera 1 hora y e visto bastantes problemas, 2 crashes y 3 bugs visuales, el juego tiene problemas mayores, se ve realmente bien e interesante pero primero se deben arreglar estos problemas mayores o al menos los crashes súbitos

Inglés
I didn't play the game more than an hour and I have a lot of issues, 2 crashes and 3 visual bugs  the game have big issues, fairly this seems pretty good but need to fix this major problems, at least the suddent crashes

Spects:
i7 10700F
32 gb ram
rx 580 8 gb

entonces no se si los bugs son causados por la tarjeta de video (que en contados juegoslas tiene) pero de verdad me gustaría poder disfrutar el juego asi que esperaré a los próximos parches hasta entonces es review negativa.

So  idk if the bugs its for the video card or something else but I really want to enjoy this game so I will wait for the next patchs until then its a negative review.

138129594,1742020,"As a free game made by indie devs, honestly? Play it for yourself. You'll only be out some time.
TL;DR: Weeb likes the love put in the game, but core mechanics don't feel right for a fighting game.

I've enjoyed my time in the rabbit hole. Been watching Vtubers on and off since Kizuna Ai. And as a whole I can see all the love they put into this. For a fan project? They knocked it out of the park. The personality of the characters really matches up well with their Vtuber. The little details, easter eggs, and voice over really shows a group that is really involved in the community. I also enjoy some fighting games. I'm no master of execution, nor do I have a PhD in mind games where I can read what you are going to write next week. But I know my way around an arcade stick. As a whole this is a good experience. If I paid $60 for this it would have been infinitely more value than Street Fighter 5 on release. More fun too, no cap.

It's nice there is an arcade mode and a rogue like mode. Online is pretty smooth. Only time I felt lag is if someone had around 200 for a ping, and I don't think that's the fault of the netcode. Training mode has all the bells and whistles you could want. Character roster has all the general niches filled, and is going to keep expanding for free. All of these things are great.

The reason I can't recommend this is that the core of the game just feels... Disjointed. Like things don't quite mesh together fully. Frame data is all over the place. Certain block strings are easy to get put into, and end without a way to punish and there is no risk. While if a single part hits, you can eat a massive combo. Down down inputs are frustrating, and tend to give you something you don't want. Certain characters (like Kaichou) feel like you need a full closet of leather and ball gags to maintain the level of masochism to learn them, let alone get decent. Grabs are incredibly inconsistent and only feel like they have use on offense, when they should be a good way to break someone's momentum if they overcommit on offense. Anti airs feel about as inconsistent as grabs. Hitboxes in general feel wrong. Movement feels slow since there is no air dash to help punish opponents. There is no block mechanic that helps push someone away so you can punish their long block strings. There are very few special moves that even allow you to mix up an opponent (The only one I saw where I had to even block high against was Suisei's two hit bash.) And for projectiles Botan can actually have more than one grenade on screen at a time. (Never seen zoners like Dhalsim in SF have multiple fireballs on screen at a time, but I could also be wrong.)

The best part about all of my gripes? They can slowly fix this as the devs slowly learn more and patch the game. There is a lot of love and potential to be found here. So I feel that over time this will become a phenomenal game. But at the end of my time with the game I can't remember ever thinking ""I deserved that win and I know why everything worked out."" or ""That was a good game from my opponent, they genuinely outplayed me."" It just felt like people mashing jab into block strings at best, and horrible trades and wonky air recovery at worst.

My advice is to just hold up and let them cook.",0
138252170,2110540,Great Game I See Potential,1
138252552,1940340,"It's running poorly to the point of being unplayable. My computer has better specs than the recommended ones and even at the lowest settings the road segments run so slowly that it is impossible to play. I haven't spent enough time in game to give it a fair review based on how it is as a game, but until this gets fixed I can't recommend",0
138253696,1940340,"It is mostly a different experience than previous game. Basically it brought more things to manage like status tokens which they allowed most of the RNG factors to be more managable but some encounters feel much harder because you can't just use all of the abilities of the heroes you have. 

In the end I hope they can fix the ability issue since it just hinders the ability to play the game much more efficently in the early stages of the game.",1
138253903,1940340,Easy game,1
137794199,1366850,"The servers don't handle it, there's a hell of a response",0
138249553,1366850,"I have played the preview versions before early access and the server were good but for some reason now with 35 current player the game really has no luck with its server there was a constant stuttering going on while playing... still got second place most of the time menaing, other people also have these problems...

then there is the thing i always said and its the flying is not good and the driving is fine but the battle royle system is just stupid to have in this game, it just doesnt make any sense, battle royle here feels more like a we dont want you to have fun with the game and instead more like a pain...

if you want to have a fun game dont throw people in a game with cars and such just out of the game, just make a point system or something like Flatout 2 did since it also seems to be the inspiration for this thing not knowing what it is and there is not even one really good thing about it in this configuration...

in the test i could see it becoming something good but yeah its pretty much a let down if nothing got changed and they just pumped it out as a free to play game, still better than to expect money for this thing
i am just mostly disappointed since it seemed like it had potential...",0
138126851,1742020,"It's pretty decent especially considering it's a free fan game
Could use some work, I'm excited to see where they may take this but how it is now it's fun but can't hold your attention for too long
I'd get a few friends together especially ones who enjoy vtubers and just have some stupid matches, but probably make sure to have something to do afterwards that has a bit more fat",1
138126893,1742020,"Been playing fighting games for a long time and I gotta say for a free game the devs did an awesome job. Easy to pick up, combos are pretty easy, netcode has been great so far when I play with friends and as a recent Hololive watcher playing as Korone has been pretty awesome.

Keep it up. And maybe add a ranked mode so I can be sweaty.",1
138126983,1742020,YO DA YO!,1
138353096,1566200,It’s like EA/NHL Hockey on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis had a love child with Speedball 2 and Binding of Isaac. Excellent roguelite sports game with HUUUUGE potential.,1
138253148,1924170,"TT3 Takes the great simulation from Rims Racing and combines it with an immersive open world set on the Isle of Man itself. Having the open world on the Isle of Man is absolutely awesome, and is much preferred to previous games open world on made up roads in Ireland. I want to point out that contrary to what T_balls implies in his review, the open world feature is not a time waster. Races and challenges are in different locations on the map, but you are not required to ride to the location to start a race. You can simply open the map and start the race from there. The simulation is much improved from the last game to be more realistic and challenging, well also being more predictable. In the previous game you might fly off your bike instantly while going straight over a small bump. TT2 also gave your tires infinite grip and would not allow you to lean too far. Though that might make the game easier if you want a more realistic simulation of a motorcycle than TT3 is the right game for you. However if you want to just chill out and go fast around a beautiful course, then you can simply turn down the simulation and it becomes much more difficult to lose control of the bike. 

A few people have been whining about not being able to flip the bike side to side in a split second. Besides the fact that they are exaggerating how much slower the transition is compared to other games, there are settings that you can change to make it more sensitive. You can also improve the way you enter a corner by trail braking more, as a bike will turn in better when the front is loaded. If you going though a fast corner that doesn't require braking you can let off slightly as you initial the lean. 

The upgrading process is much more convenient and easy to use than the previous game. All you need to do is get upgrade points from racing, then spend them on upgrades. There is no requirement to complete other things to unlock access to high level upgrades before you can buy them.  

There are a couple bugs I have found as per our usual arrangement with new games I guess. One bug involves not being able to shift gears when you start a race or challenge. This seems to only happen occasionally, and when it does you can fix it by exiting the race, shifting gear in the open world (you are always in the open world if not in a race or challenge), then restart the race. You do not need to restart the game. I have also experienced an audio bug where after riding around for about 30 minutes sometimes the engine sound at low RPM will be distorted and shifting sounds slower. However no one else seems to have had that issue. 

Overall I recommend this game to any racing fan, and especially any motorcycle racing fan. The game is quite immersive and can also be a great teacher of all things TT related.",1
138129204,24010,Flying Scotsman activities are useless and unrealistic particularly last two activities in which you have to go close to 100 mph but whatever you do you never cross 85 mph. Total waste of money. These Dovetail people are nothing but gold diggers. I still miss my Microsoft Train Simulator which was way ahead of its time when it was released and so many challenging activities. My dear fellows don't waste your money on this crap.,0
138127222,2001340,"The sequel to using furry children as live ammunition game.

CC2 delivers another fantastic entry in the Little Tail Bronx series.

Fun new systems to play with, and a slightly annoying graphical bug aboard your steel clad home remains unfixed. 

Visuals cute, story really good, music is great, game is great. As story focused as a game like this is, the only other minor gripe I would have is that the recap doesn't really do a very solid job of re-capping anything. It's a clip show with dialogue playing out the events of the prior game. This of course isn't a problem if you have played the first game, and I would recommend you do so anyway.",1
138127554,758690,"For being in Early Access my first impressions are great !

The game is in the EA phase, but you can already see that it has great potential. Game have some bugs but thats why is in EA. It was a really good choice on behalf of the developers to have both a campaign and a more open survival experience in this one. In my opinion, the freeplay mode is far beyond the campaign.

So please enjoy!",1
138097290,1186660,"Crikey mate! This game brought me and me son closer together than a dingo and her pup! As someone who's always out working, it's hard to find time to bond with the little one, but this game was a ripper!

Bare Butt Boxing is an ace action game with kid-friendly looks. The controls are as sweet as a lamington, but we reckon an air dash would be grouse for more action and reaction time. All in all, we'd recommend it to anyone, especially when played with ya mates and family. It's bonzer fun!",1
138092191,1269300,"Crashes a lot. people cannot join mid game. Ship hull mechanic is stupid. 
Not a casual game, be ready to think about some strats and get good scrubs.",0
138110732,1269300,"This game has fun moments for sure and at the start its pretty nice while playing with a friend. However, I feel like that is where it falls short because if you only have one friend that you're playing with then the game seems next to impossible to complete. Not to mention single player mode where I was on the easiest difficulty, made it up to the third boss without taking barely any damage and with 70hp on my ship. Two AI crewmates by my side, we are outnumbered 3 to 5 and each component of the boss takes atleast 3 shots to destroy. This probably wouldn't be an issue because they only had 1 gun so if I could keep that out of action I might squeak away with a victory, BUT they had this massive missile that you could NOT damage and my anti-gun turrets couldn't destroy it's projectiles either. So I die pretty easily despite not having an issue until this point. To make things even better though, I find out that this was only stage ONE of a THREE stage boss!

The game is terribly unbalanced in terms of difficulty, with how it currently scales I firmly believe that not a single individual would be able to beat this game in single player mode or even with two of you. When this game fixes its difficulty problem (personally I think that an ""easy"" difficulty should mean that the game is winnable without having to stress too much) then I will alter my review. Unfortunately it took me over 2 hours to figure out that this game was impossible to finish so I am unable to refund, but just be aware that currently you are paying for half a product when purchasing.",0

138250975,1669000,"I'm only 6 hours into the game, so this is only my first impression.

I played AOW3 and Planetfall and from what I have seen yet, AOW4 took the best of those games and added more good stuff. The customizability definetly increased.

I disagree with some of the negative reviews that complain about not having magical alignment anymore. I think by combining several magical tomes, the factions you can create become even more diverse, not less. Also if you want, you can specialise still.

So far I didn't have a single crash and I didn't see any bugs in singleplayer (only some poor translation to German). Multiplayer seems to have some problems at the moment, but I'm sure they will sort that out soon.

That's it for now. I like this game so far. I'll add more details when I played it more.",1
138249423,1669000,"The game dynamics are fun, yet network replication and general multiplayer experience is highly buggy. I wouldn't expect such ha high-effort game to be released without thorough testing. Not ready yet.",0
138249626,1669000,"I was really looking forward to playing with my friends, but unfortunately, we were unable to enjoy it due to the numerous game-breaking bugs. 

We encountered connection problems, frequent crashes and freezes that made the game unplayable. It's frustrating that such a promising title with great potential is ruined by technical problems that should have been fixed before release. 

It's also disappointing that the developers seem to be slow in addressing these issues and providing adequate support. I would not recommend this game to anyone who wishes to enjoy multiplayer until the problems are resolved.

In our latest attempt, the game couldn't manage to place players into their chosen teams.",0
138249742,1669000,"This game inspires me to become a game designer, because it made clear to me just how incompetent the competition is: I could make quite a career in that field. I researched on linkedin who the designers are, because I wanted to make sure whether they started their careers at a circus. Imagine having a turn based game, but locking the players out of continuing doing their turn when others fight their battle... even though that outcome makes no difference to the other players (unless they plan to attack your army straight after - something that could be solved easily. Naturally this makes the tbs tactical combat part of the game unplayable and the game, for me, pointless, since there's civ, TW and other such games where I can play mappainter simulation. The worst part really is that it is absolutely unnecessary. This is even true for player decisions, but I gove them the benefit of the doubt that there are decisions causing huge map changes for everyone (not!). Imagine spending 10 minutes in your tactical and then when you click end turn after you still have to wait because your opponents weren't able to do their stuff in the meanwhile. Mindboggling!
The devs clearly NEVER played theor own game even once - maybe just the small parts of the game they personally had to design, but never the entire thing.

All that said: the game feels quite immersive and the graphics are nice. Things feel a bit unresponsive at times - this, too, is a design decision, not a technical limitation.",0

138272879,1494420,"The game has so much potential.  In it's current state, it is not worth $20.  The enjoyment of the game right now comes from how awesome it feels to be immersed in a giant battle, especially at night.

I am excited to see where this game goes in it's development.",1

All kinds of EA nonsense that is mostly overlooked for an otherwise VERY fun game and very pretty.

Two current glaring issues.

1. Harvesters: They will lose you the game.

2. Switching Teams mid-game: This allows for Team Switch Team Kill. Doesn't happen often, but when it does it'll really piss you off. Especially because there are no names yet, so they can do it completely anonymously. They can literally join your team without you knowing, take one of your heavy vehicles, and bomb your headquarters. Or just spawn camp and gun down all of your players so they can't do anything. Extremely annoying. MUST CHANGE.",1

Fine by me because I played the first game 2 or 3 times and I'm up for new content. So I guess I can only recommend it under the circumstance that you liked the first game and aren't tired of it.

The AI is better. They can't see backwards anymore, they will run out of the house before calling the cops, and some will even attack you with pepper spray before doing so, which makes escaping more difficult. However, they're completely oblivious to things like open front doors. It's not that game changing, but the biggest improvement from the OG game so far.",1

I'm most excited for the idea of a ""free mode"", just toss me in a sandbox of thievery and I can make my own way. I'm a little worried for the changes in AI that will apparently make houses increasingly difficult as you get caught. Tenants will apparently be more alert, which during this demo I found that save-scumming is the way to go. Every time I got caught I found it more economic to just reload from my checkpoint.

138370234,1581480,"One of the things my girlfriend and I do together is watch live gaming events like Summer Games Fest and State of Play whenever they happen, the latter of which is where I first saw this game. I downloaded the demo when it was available and was instantly hooked on the sound design and gameplay. Coming from the developers of Tetris Effect, I expected no less, However they knocked this one out of the park. The music reminds me of the music from Bit.TRIP Runner (or Runner 1), where the music starts off as a simple melody and as you progress through the level, the music grows more and more complex. I also really dig the level editor and online map element which is such a smart way to add replay value and creativity to a game.",1
138350493,1669000,"I never thought i would say this: its better than homm 3, and it is all i ever wanted since then. Its been 10+ years since i've been so happy about a purchase from a non-indie studio. its actually a good base game, something you cant say about a lot of games that relies on exspansion packs in this age. I am a very happy customer. UI is my only complaint, but it is not ruining my experience.",1
138350792,1669000,"Planetfall Veterans read: 

If you are in the verge of getting it and you come from playing/liking Planetfall's mechanics, prepare for disappointment. There is no cover system, no stagger, no tactical advantage because positioning don't matter, attack forces will start head to head no matter how they were placed in the campaign map. First action point isn't free anymore, you move you lose. There isn't a practical approach to strategy, no matter what you do, you end up clumping your units together to get the ""buffs"" from your casters. 

Although flanking is there, ""flanker"" type of units are very rare. Critical hits as of today, come before accuracy, so you could crit. with 5% accuracy. The ""Overwatch"" mechanic, both melee and ranged, is GONE. Instead we have a very confusing ""attacks of opportunity"" for melee only that feels more like a way for the AI to hit you more than you, because until you learn it, your units will die a lot for it. It has to do with these ""zones of control"" which is the three hexes in front of a unit (all around if they are in defense mode), any unit who comes in contact with those hexes supposedly gets attacked (not sure because sometimes it happens sometimes it doesn't), however if two units are in front of you only one will trigger it (the one right in front) but I have seen the AI using both; I don't know how to so I might be doing something wrong.

But my biggest gripe I have with this game is Healing. Healing is not healing anymore but covering holes with the ""Temporary Hit Points"" system. It just heals ""temporary hit points"" which are then taken once battle is over so you will go around the map with hurt troops most of the time. You can regenerate in your territory but then who wants to be there? Also, AI cheats like there's no tomorrow even on Normal difficulty, also is greedy on grabbing land even if it's right next to your cities. Graphically speaking, they did a decent job, but still the units themselves feel all the same, some share the same model and animation just a different skin leading to awkward attack animations. There is a heavy leaning towards a rock/paper/scissors system and as a result units are simplistic: sword and shield, ranged, pike, battle mage, support mage, and cavalry. Better, higher-tier units are obtained through a Tome system (the research) along with spells, but they're tied to those tomes and ultimate units (Tier 5) feel most of the time as resources wasted. The game has HUGE potential, HUGE, but right now it feels crude, rough and with lots of mechanics affecting the fun factor. 

Once they update the game to a better state, I will come back and change my rating.",0

138093108,2229260,"I played Eden Eternal back when it was first released all the way up to 2016. I spent hours on this game and I can assure you it was well deserved. It is the kind of mmorpg I always wanted. The style is adorable, the story is cute, fun to play with others and meet new people, and who doesn't love Alpacas? ^u^ 

I am so happy to see Eden Eternal back, and now available on steam. The way it is playing right now reminds me when the game first came out all those years back. Sure there is a cap at lv 45 right now, but trust me when I say this, it won't stay long. There is many many more lands to travel, and if i can recall i was lv 100. :) 


What we have right now is Classic Eden Eternal. What the game was when it first released. There is nothing wrong with that either as I know over time they will add the other features back. The game is quite large, so working with a smaller portion of it, will probably help the creators fix any bugs and issues at the begging. And as time progresses and bugs are fixed, they will keep patching and updating until we get the Eden I played around 2014 to 2016. :) 

As for the whole paywall. I have always been a member who played without purchasing real in game items. The prices are not all that bad. We need to remember we are playing a classic MMORPG ten years later. With inflation and other things going on, prices have gone up everywhere and on others games too. It's not all the bad for this game considering I have seen prices waaaay higher elsewhere. It stinks sure, but again, we need to remember the times we are currently faces in the world right now. For the game to stay up an run well, we need to consider they also need to fix the currency to match the now times. :) 

Also, This game  doesn't have to be a pay to win/progress, do your daily missions, do the book missions from the merchant, finish all the main missions, have a relationship with another player to gain exp bonus, and join a guild. Doing all this and you will have no problems making in game currency and exp if your having issues.  Will it take longer? Sure? But rewards after for it is worth it. :)  If you want to pay  real currency for outfits and mounts, nothing wrong with that, but as stated before, do realize prices have gone up because in this day in age, everything prices have gone up, and developers needed to make adjustments to afford keeping the severs running. :)

Over all guys, just have fun! The world of Eden Eternal is exciting!! And for those new, don't let negative comments keep you from trying it yourself. Give it ago, and judge it with your own opinions. :) 

P.s. I Hope to see Sakura Island reappear at Aven too! Loved going there even with the creepy music. x,D

138068324,1277920,"[h1]Like most modern releases, it has had a rough start[/h1]
Let me start off with stating that my first MMOs were Ultima Online, and playing on a friend's EverQuest account when I stayed over at his house (I was in Junior High when I got my first PC). You can also knock ~8 hours or so off my play time, as the first day or two that was spent in the queue.

I love the way the game feels. There is limited guidance, and very little information past the intro sequence is handed to you. Everything you do feels like a discovery. There was a bunch of us running around the starting island trying to figure out how the heck to craft the next tier (iron) of weapons (the first tier recipes are provided from a quest). Need better potions? Better figure out how to make them, as the recipe was not available on the starting island. This is definitely not friendly to those will limited time to drop in and out unless you have a guild that can assist with helping you gear up while you quest and farm EXP. There is also (at the time of writing), not a lot of content past the starting island which is 20-30 hours of gameplay if you try to experience it all (can probably speedrun through the quests in a few hours if you know where to go).

The best way I can describe this game is that it's an amalgamation of Ultima Online, Tibia, and RuneScape. And I hope it does well. [b]Wait until May 12 to start, as there will be a wipe.[/b]",1
138053197,1277920,"After reading the reviews I expected this game would be absolute garbage.

I was surprised to find the contrary.  This is very much an old school mmo.  For reference it is not WoW theme park trash or pay to win garbage.  If you want to learn a recipe, craft something or complete a quest its on your to read, pay attention, and figure it out.  It doesn't hold your hand, and its not forgiving.

But that is exactly what I'm after as an oldschool mmo player.  The negative reviews are most likely children expecting instant gratification and can't afford a $10 sub.  Which by the way I hope they never remove because sub model makes the devs work to keep their player base.

138350000,2002220,"There's still little content to the game, if that's the fact that there are only 2 classes, or only 2 maps, but if the developers continue their work in that manner it may a promising bullet hell in the genre of Vampire survivors and the likes.

Regarding the Necromancer, the idea to use movement in such a way for the flail is a nice addition

It's not entirely obvious which damage is considered physical and which is magical so maybe you could provide a note for every skill indicating the one or the other.

Also there are no stats for the skills, could do it in the way Nordic Ashes does it, so that you'd know what it actually does without guessing and maybe even what upgrades add to the skill.

I don't like the idea that you have to collect gold for upgrades for each class separately, I hope that it's only for testing purposes since there's not that much content, it's not a mmorpg with subscription time that you should care how I spend my time within the game, if I want to use one class to grind for others it should be my choice, you could see how it works in 

It's not clear at the beginning that the talents unlock after each 5 upgrades, so could also add that info

The Sundance curse slows you too much, you can't do anything so eventually you'll just get killed by ranged attacks even if monsters can't reach you in melee, or just get killed by picking cursed souls even if you don't want to.

138349193,1294810,"TL;DR - Can I recommend this game? Having finished it with a friend on the 3rd (of four) hardest difficulty, I guess the answer is no. 
It is good, in places. It's fun, in places. But if I recommended it to a friend, I'd inevitably feel embarrassed at all the bugs and poor design choices made by the devs. 

Redfall is a game that really needed another year or so of development to realise it's true potential. It's closest to a looter-shooter, sort of like a Borderlands game, but truly open world. It's got two maps that admittedly aren't huge, but you can freely sprint from one side of the map to the other with no loading screens. 
It's full of that Arkane style we all know and love, but at times it does feel empty. Big areas with no enemies that you just skip over heading to the next waypoint. Lots of scattered journals with lore dumps that you are mostly going to skip over and ignore.

The game works as follows: You quickly make your way to the quest hub and pick up a main quest and perhaps a side mission and head out into the world to complete it. Rinse and repeat. They are either fetch quests or kill quests. There are a handful of quick travel points spread across the map, as well as half a dozen safehouses too. The safehouses need to be unlocked, and each have first a quest to complete (one of four types), and then ""kill a mini-boss"" quest to complete. The safehouse unlocks are required to complete the main story. After you have done the main quests, you defeat the map's boss. Then you move on to map 2 and do it all again.
The loot is quite generic and has a level stat and a quality level. It's not that easy to work out when a weapon with level X is better than a lower level weapon with a better quality, other than 'are numbers bigger ok i pick this one'.

All together these features would make the game acceptable. But what really let's the game design are the cutscenes and AI. 
Firstly the AI is quite basic. Vampires will always teleport and charge you. By backing away and jumping you can usually completely avoid their attacks. The human enemies have that fun feature of once you're spotted, everybody knows exactly where you are instantly. Retreat and hide and reposition, it doesn't matter. They still know where you are. And obviously there have been multiple instances of enemies standing still and glaring at you and doing nothing, seemingly unable to attack.
Secondly the cutscenes. They have clearly been done quickly and spat out. There's no character animation. You're basically watching a comic strip of images with a narrator over the top. Even the few in game ones that you watch (past memories of bosses giving us story exposition) are with static models, very similar to the game Tacoma (an indie game with approx. 4-10 devs). It feels rushed and half-hearted.

Slap on top a plethora of bugs like weapon glitches, unable to melee/stake enemies, T-poses, graphical oddities, a weird one where I slid down some stairs and carried on across the map and turning my vision upside-down, disconnects and the inability to reconnect to any game in progress, fps drops, makes this a poor poor recommendation. 

The problem is in six months many bugs will be squashed, but the rushed feel of the game will remain and will never be fixed. Arkane have already moved on to the next game in line, which I will not be buying.",0

138278425,1159690,"Has some bugs, but definitely good for an Early Access game, especially compared to what most other developers have been releasing under the Early Access tag in the recent years.

First of all, the thing that has been bothering me the most. The incredibly tiny stack sizes AND chests. So far I've gotten to the 2nd tier of buildings, and even the T2 chests are pretty small with only 6 slots. It's really difficult managing all of them, trying to find where your materials are and everything. With the small stack sizes of only 10 items, it gets really frustrating. And don't even get me started on storing weapon components.

The second thing that has been bothering me the most, the fuel inside the crafting stations and machines (or whatever you want to call them) last for an annoyingly short amount of time. I've spent most of the time just grinding for wood, because I keep running out of charcoal. Even the coal or coal briquettes don't last very long considering how rare they are.

Weapon components aren't very descriptive, they don't really tell you what they do until you put them onto a weapon. Even the stats they show when you hover over them don't really seem to correspond with what they really do. They aren't intuitive and require a lot of trial and error to figure out. 

And for last, the combat is a little janky. You can't change your ADS sensitivity, it's the same as your regular sensitivity. The hitboxes of some items are just plain stupid, you try to shoot an enemy, but instead hit the leaf of a bush which was in front of him, the bullet shatters and the guy you tried shooting at - unscathed and unbothered, and of course he can shoot through that same bush.

I'm giving this game a positive review, because I believe it has great potential. The gameplay is fun (other than the 3 things I mentioned previously), the story keeps you on your toes, wondering what's going to happen next The arenas have quite rewarding challenges. Despite what some of the negative reviews say, I haven't really had any game-breaking or annoying issues with the game, other than the first day of playing, but the developers patched all of the annoying bugs I was dealing with the very next day.",1
138278888,1159690,"The closest game comparison to VoidTrain would probably be Viscera Cleanup Detail.

In VoidTrain, you are a janitor tasked with slowly cleaning up the debris scattered around the Void Rail, long after a much more interesting story took place. To cope with having such a lowly and meaningless career, you pretend that there is a mad scientist on the loose who is being chased down by the largest family of identical brothers that ever existed: The Generic Brothers!

The Generic Boys will definitely be some of the smartest, omnipotent rivals you've faced. They have impeccable aim, clairvoyance to know when a gun is trained on their location, and the ability to take several bullets in the head while pretending to be staring at the rocks, only to have Brother #55 attack your flank.

If you are fortunate enough to claim victory over the GenBros, you feel a rush from acquiring one of these super weapons they used to rain hellfire upon you! Rapid Fire! Eagle Eye Accuracy! Unfortunately, your tainted Janitor hands are a curse upon these fine objects, leaving you with a quality that matches their patchwork looks.

During your journey you will long for a different view, anything to break up the monotonous scenery and tedium of continuously collecting garbage to convert into usable materials...so that you can collect even shinier garbage to add to your train filled with trash boxes and non-integrative crafting stations.

Using your wits and the junk that you've hoovered up, you create a hookshot device so that you can pretend that you're playing Raft, only to discover that the hook is just out of reach of every object in sight. Resigning to manual drift collection, you realize how unlike Raft your janitorial job has become. If only you had placed higher on your aptitude test, you could be traversing the oceans in any direction. Instead, you were better suited for a one-way path with little divergence to confuse your limited capabilities.

Eventually you'll come across a strange entity trapped in amber. Ignoring your primal instincts to scatterblast the creature into oblivion, you take it on as a taskhand. Each time you pick up this entity, it begs you to toss it into the Void, ending its useless existence. But, since you don't understand its language, you continue to allow it to stay aboard your Garbage Train, reading the same upside down comic book over and over.
In an attempt to find a greater purpose than that of a Void Janitor, this creature will stand in the middle of the platform walkway just to annoy you by blocking your path. But fortune smiles upon you once again! Because there is no roof to this train that will prevent you from hopping over the little slimeball. Its the minigames like this that really lift the spirits on the 'Storage Box Express' during the slower collection days.

As time passes and the collection continues, you begin to realize how grateful you are to not be distracted from your duties by any change in scenery. You feel at ease knowing that the floating bells and chains will always be there, as well as those floating islands that are just out of reach.
Those same floating islands will fuel your dreams that one day you'll be able to somehow 'wench' your way over and plant your feet upon their surfaces. It will be a glorious day of exploration and new investigations. NO WAY will your attempts to stick these islands with your wench rings be deflected into the Void, leaving you yearning for your time and money back.

Until that day arrives, you can huddle around the hobo bbq for a tasty bite of Grilled Organics, which is most likely some form of human adipose tissue, left over from whatever catastrophe occurred that caused this Void realm. After, you can wash it down with a nice chunk of Void Ice while contemplating the source of this non-melting rock. But, then you recall your favorite movie, 'Joe Dirt.' You found yourself a Lucky Meteor! Enjoy your Space Peanuts.

138099229,2211730,"Killbug is good, the combat is fast and easy to understand with plenty to learn. It's all very well crafted and it still does deserve a positive review however it is very disappointing to see how shallow and basic the game is. 

The gameplay is very solid, it's very simple, you are in an arena and enemies approach you and you must kill them, you gain a score for killing the enemies and your only objective is to get the highest score possible. The game's difficulty increases as the timer increases. This basic gameplay is very simple and fun, it's quite addictive in the manner that you always wanna reach a higher score. There is a single gun which is a SMG style weapon which fits the frantic and speedy movement. There is a wall running and an awesome blade on a cool down that will allow you to dash. All of this movement really makes the games this game so exciting, climbing and zipping around to avoid the hordes of bugs chasing you. It would have been nice to see more weapons, it could've added so much more complexity to the game, imagine what a shotgun or rocket launched could have added to the gameplay experience. It's a shame but the SMG still suits the purpose.There is even a feature that allows you to shoot in the air to decrease your falling speed, similar to something you’d see in Devil May Cry. The level design is really good, the map is almost perfect for the move set the player has, it's all about verticality and getting plenty of speed. I would have loved to have seen another map as playing on the same one can get a little repetitive after playing for 30+ minutes.The enemy design here is pretty cool, everything is trying to kill you and there are normally many things chasing you down. Other than that there is not much else going on, there is some pretty neat UI which is simple and good. Something that was surprising is there isnt even achievements for some extra challenge. 

The art is really good here, it's old and retro looking but is really good, very strong use of colour and the general look of everything is great. It would have been nice to have the option to lower some of the pixelation however as it can look a little blurry at distances, it's not awful and probably won't bother many but it would be a nice feature. The music here is really interesting, it's pretty damn good considering how basic the game is. The performance is perfect and it will run amazingly on most generally up to date PCs, there was not a single bug or crash i encountered during my playtime. I really wish there were some more settings to allow for some accessibility, there really isn't too much, it was cool seeing some features to lower weapons and head bob. 

To conclude the game is good but lacks a lot of depth, it's just about worth its price but I'd say there are many more games that do a lot more for much less. I am leaving a positive review since the game isn't bad at all and there is fun to be had. I am hoping the game receives further support and it can get a little more depth into it.

138076272,2010380,GAAARRRRRBAAAGGGE .... they should pay reparations for this BS,0
138096295,1622800,"Finished making my first major dungeon.  This game, both in game and in editor is too glitchy for a 1.0 release, but most of it can be worked around.  I'm guessing it was getting patched as I was working on it as some of the glitchiness (like with permanent staircase removals) stopped happening.

There are also limited dev options but that is true of most game-maker games...that's why you are playing the Zelda dungeon maker instead of building dungeons from the ground up in Game Maker (which is a lot more work and a lot more things going wrong).  You lose versatility for the sake of efficiency.  This is still a lot more robust than trying to make maps in Timesplitters or something similar.  A good designer can definitely still express unique and interesting ideas with this, but on the surface a basic dungeon is going to feel the same as a lot of others.

It lacks rewards for the player, making it difficult to add hidden or optional sections as there isn't much reason to explore.  Some kind of in game economy would fix this, even just a simple score board that shows how many rupees (or it's equivalent) a player got with maybe a few other metrics.  I would love to have this because I want to have the ability to put in more optional content, places where I would stick harder puzzles or tougher encounters that might be a roadblock for players otherwise.  Plus, it's Zelda, exploration is a key part of the fun and there isn't a great way to encourage it.

Tool-wise, it definitely could use some features, notably a better fill system, the ability to select select, drag, and copy/paste multiple tiles at once (I was really surprised this isn't in the game tbh), and the ability to 'save' what you copied to reduce future work.  Dungeon wise, I would like the ability to control individual sound effects and lighting changes with triggers.  Just these two changes would allow for a far greater variety in the feel of dungeons and would extend the shelf-life a ton with the game, and since they are just aesthetic, it wouldn't over complicate the basic dungeon making for the average user.  These should be easier asks than adding, for instance, another boss monster type.

I'm leaving a positive review as I have wanted a proper Zelda dungeon maker for years and this does deliver that, but the appeal is limited right now.  As I noted above, unless you are invested and work well with limitations, you probably aren't going to have a masterpiece dungeon pop out in front of you, and playing random dungeons has limited appeal.  While some dungeons can be excellent, this isn't Mario Maker where you are looking at a 5 minute commitment usually, so playing even one mediocre stage feels like a lot and creators also have to put in more work to make something passably fun.  What this means is, you'll be playing more rough than diamonds.

BOTTOM LINE (TLDR): If you like Zelda dungeons and have ever wanted to make your own (and/or are worried about Nintendo's ability to keep this style going), go ahead and dive in!  The devs seem to still be putting in patches and features.  It is very close to being 'good', frustratingly so even, but right now it is just 'okay'.  With some updates, this could be great.",1

138254200,1669000,"This is a great game but it needs more time in the oven. Even in its current form it's very addictive, but anyone buying it should understand that it still has a pretty hefty number of bugs. It has some visual glitches but I honestly don't care much about that, far more serious are the many gameplay and ability bugs currently in the game, ranging from small nuisances to serious bugs. It's quite playable ( and very fun! ) but just buggy at the moment.

Definitely *strongly* recommend but you may possibly want to wait for more patches. Both Triumph and Paradox generally have good long-term support for their games so I am confident this will get where it needs to be.",1

138112523,2086140,"It is kinda fun, but I never know why I die. I try and focus on defensives. I will be full health then dead(Hardest difficulty). Just not enough info. Things are deliberately obscure as part of the aesthetic, which can be fine if there is a way to figure it out. It is cheap enough you can probably ignore this and get fun out of it. It has potential for sure. I would personally recommend others in this genre before this one.",0
138100937,2086140,"First I'd like to say that I enjoy this game and think it's a great deal, I've already played about as many hours as dollars I've spent and enjoyed most of the gameplay.  The blackhole is very fun to use, the weapons are all unique and cool, and the weapon upgrade and targeting system is tactical and different. The depraved/verdant and ice/fire interactions are neat and I'd love for it to be built upon further for more scaling and run diversity.  I like the uniqueness of the planet concept, and the intro when you first launch the game is a fun and immersive way to calibrate the settings.  

I do think however  it's a weird design choice to be able to get meta currency if you lose a run on the first stage, but not when you clear the first but die on the second.  I understand it's a double or nothing thing, but I think you should at least be able to get the original currency you gained out of it, but just not with the multiplier attached.  Obviously when people win on the first stage you'd want to continue, because you have a fun run going and you want to get more weapons to golden and keep your run alive because you feel strong.  But if you die during the second stage it feels like you just did all that for nothing, and it encourages you to make safe plays like exiting out of the first stage with pitiful earnings that can barely get you a silver medal over and over to grind the meta currency when it's clear that the goal of the game is to gamble and push to the next stages for the big multipliers so when your run inevitably ends you are happy since you got tons of currency for meta progression.  I found out about this game from a youtuber called Retromation, and in the comments of his video the dev even stated that the game should be beatable without meta currency, so the grind is not supposed to be a large factor in the game loop.  After a couple of runs losing to the second stage in a row I feel like I've been playing for nothing and that my runs have been meaningless, because even though I've had fun clearing the first stage, I lose everything and need to start over without having progressed.  I think in order to achieve the little wins even when you ultimately lose that many games with meta progression often seek, the double or nothing system should be tweaked.  I recommend just cutting the multiplier if you die, since then it's as if you died during the first stage without clearing, meaning you're still losing something you risked which would be the multiplier, but you're walking out gaining something as well.",1

138110194,1277920,"Lots of potential here. Slower pacing is great, combat is fun, crafting is rewarding, various interesting puzzles and secrets to find. I was really looking forward to exploring and doing some dungeons with my friends. 

Ultimately, however, the game was simply nowhere near ready to be released. Lots of gamebreaking issues - gold dupes, infinite xp exploits, bugged quests preventing a large number of classes from obtaining baseline abilities (Catching every possible exploit isn't exactly a fair ask, but if a game releases with 20 classes and level 5 class quests are broken for 8 of them, it makes me feel like very little testing went into the game prior to release). 

Additionally, there is a staggering lack of content on the main continent after completing the relatively dense and polished starting island. I spent roughly 60 hours running around exploring and trying to interact with the litany of cut and paste NPCs that I couldn't get to reply to any text prompts, and was able to find a total of 5 quests and 4 dungeons. Of the 5 quests, 2 were bugged. Of the 4 dungeons, I wasn't even able to enter the portal for 2 of them for an unknown reason, the enemies were much higher level than me in another, and neither the enemies nor bosses dropped loot in the last. I have plenty of time to play games and honestly don't even mind running around for hours looking for secrets as long as there is SOME sort of reward at the end - interesting storyline, items, puzzles, clues, etc. But finding a well-hidden cave and fighting my way through all the monsters in it to find a quest at the end, only to have that quest not function properly, is depressing. And finding a secret dungeon and getting four of your friends to log on and run 40 mins to your location only to find that the bosses don't drop a single item is just so disheartening. 

It looks like the small development team is doing their best to fix the truly gamebreaking issues so the game will at least be somewhat playable for re-launch on May 12, but it seems to me like this game could really use another year of development with proper testing rather than a week of bandaid fixes.",0

Meta-progression is minuscule and seems very necessary. It's also beyond confusing and has no real information. The power-ups and meta-progressions that have the cheeky names and no information are not fun.

138252774,1669000,"Absolutely loving this game so far.  Best 4X game on the market if you ask me.  [i]However...[/i]

This game is absolutely cooking my CPU, and since the latest update, hard crashing my entire rig after a random amount of time.  5900X / 6800XT with 32GBs of DDR5 and I'm averaging around 71FPS with 100% CPU usage the entire time.  (For comparison, Cyberpunk at max settings (no raytracing) runs at a steady 140-150FPS at 1440p.)  The only other program I have that gets my CPU that hot is Cinebench.  I don't have my AC on yet so it's a little warmer inside than I'd like, but hitting 100% CPU load and 70-75C on a 360mm AIO playing a 4X game?  All other games I play barely breach 60C right now.  

GPU usage is also very low with mid 50C temps, barely any fanspeed, and yet my CPU is going through hell and back to keep this thing running.  Changing graphics settings from max to low is negligible for performance gains as well.  There's definitely some major issues under the game's hood right now, which is a real shame because it's such a damn good game.

So unfortunately, until the devs address the horrible performance and stability issues, I simply can't recommend the game in its current state.",0
138253316,1669000,"I don't feel like AoW4 brings anything new to the table. They're probably going to let the real new features be slipped in with expansions and not just from the get go.

I mean a narrator? I never saw that coming the VA is such a blast. Even just visually, the game has a unique look and feel that makes me consider my money well spent only *four hours in*. 

The devs seem to be very on top of any major issues that pop up and are handling this like a good early access should be handled. If you're okay playing a game in a state where crashes, bugs, and other issues *might* be something you come across, with the upside of getting to influence the direction of the game as its developed, then please try it! There's tons of room to grow here and a dev team that seems ready to see it through. Need I remind people of games like Raft and Deep Rock Galactic when they first released in EA? They were a hot mess at the best of times and look at them now - for smaller teams an EA release is the best way to make sure the final product is as good as can be so ignore the complaining that the 'tutorial is too hard' after an hour of gameplay (seriously. do these people even play games at all?) and start playing!",1

Now after it came to Steam I went and got it again to support Red Hook further, as I loved DD1.
DD2 is a great game and I loved the direction they went. It's new. It's building upon the lore. It's only at version 1.0.

Those who played DD1 should remember how the game was on initial release and how great it became after Red Hook fine-tuned the game and climaxed with the release of their two expansions.

We are in good hands and should await the growth of DD2 instead of mindlessly hating the game loop. It's still within the Darkest Dungeon world (lore).

Hovertanks, Giant Bugs, guns and swarms of dancing crabs, towering refineries and giant bug nests are just a taste of what's in the game currently.

The problem giving a flat recommendation for this is the fact that it is VERY Early Access. Bugs (Pun Intended), glitches, gamebreaking stuff is all here.

138129295,1494420,"saw this from a youtube vid, decided to give it a shot with a buddy of mine. SOLID base game here, worth $20 just for what is available now (especially when roleplaying as starship troopers). Both on the ground FPS & up above RTS gameplay is fun, however there is definitely room to expand and iterate upon here with future updates. 

Ground Combat View: definitely needs some jetpacks or something to help make moving about the map much faster as currently the only option is to run everywhere and thats not that fun. also some grenades or other options other than primary firearm would be nice.

Commander RTS View: definitely needs some work on the presentation of the UI, text is very small and hard to read in current build. There is a fair selection of buildings here on offer, however there are no upgrades whatsoever. Either unit upgrades i.e. faster firing/reload speed/etc or building upgrades i.e. faster production/etc would be very nice to help flesh out RTS gameplay. Also the ability to make multiple soldiers instead of just one at a time would be a nice addition. Additionally, not having the ability to choose the target of whatever unit you currently have selected i.e. tank/soldier is lowkey frustrating when trying to coordinate an attack on the enemy base.

However despite these small frustrations mentioned above, the game currently is alot of fun with friends and the bones here are solid and ripe with potential to be expanded upon with future updates. 

Conclusion: I would highly recommend giving this game a shot if you think it looks cool and have some friends who wouldn't mind dropping $20 to try a new game out. I eagerly look forward to this game's future and seeing what it develops into overtime.",1

This game is fantastic (extreme graphics, look sick) i'm kidding they look like sh*t BUT ANYWAYS.
Once you get past level 2, the whole game is kinda trash, not gonna lie.
But it was still an amazing experience running around in Kingshil and shouting in region chat that i was a ""runaway black slave dwarf who escape the shackles of his owner"". (I will never work in the cotton field ever again) 

I rate the game 4.5/10, not the best game if you're a 100% eastern europe racist like i.

This game is a steal at this price, steam remote play together makes this game hours and hours of fun. There are a few frustrations here and there, but the devs are lightning fast with patches that have already solved most of the early issues I had with the game.

It's a well made fighting game, so much so that it's surprising to think about how this is a fan-made game. The team behind this game put two years of work into this game despite knowing they would not be making any money off of this project. The game is truly a labor of love, with a very passionate dev team behind it.

It's hard for me to not recommend this game as for one, it's a free game. The only thing you have to give to play it is your time. If you end up not liking it, that's fine, but at least you didn't have to give your money and your time.",1

And you guys are thinking of releasing the full game later this year? You should think twice about that, this game needs so much more, polish & work to be done to become a good game.

The graphics in the game are beautiful and meticulously detailed. The game world is rich in color and visually stunning, allowing for complete immersion in it and empathizing with the main character.

138030722,2091300,"if you want a quick, satisfying action arcade game, look no further! It's a ""run and gun"" like Contra or Metal Slug, but with more inventive controls, slightly randomized stages, and deeper, zanier weapon variety. The two playable characters are completely different; EN-Phantom is mostly traditional, while RD-Aster is like a ranged-melee hybrid. Each are fun to use with diverse arsenals, but Phantom is definitely the more accessible of the two. You unlock new weapons during each play-through, and testing them is pretty fun (and addictive). Overall, the weapons seem balanced, but you might find that some have certain ""roles"", which can influence your choice of loadout.

The game's visuals are really unique (and readable) and the music rocks! As another reviewer said, the difficulty and enemy telegraphing are quite fair, though I do die a lot. Part of the reason might be that I put points into ammo and mobility instead of armor! That's my lifestyle. If I had to nitpick, the narrative elements are basic, and the game lacks a tutorial, but these are hardly problems for an arcade-style game like this, in my opinion. The controls take about a minute to figure out, and the core gameplay is excellent, probably better than most games of this genre (even the big ones). Highly recommended!",1

This is a  [u]roguelite traveling road [/u], absolutely pointless but fun in DD way. You see, in DD you perfectly understand why do you go to the dungeons and the whole story behind your ancestor and the hamlet. 
[i]Was so cool to return from dungeon and find out the Barbarians rock-fest in a tavern. Or when you needed a slot in a hospital but it is already taken :D All these little details...[/i]

Here you see the Mountain, ""2 regions left before  the Mountain"", now ""you enter the Mountain""... what for? Why should I travel there? 
What is the story  behind this inn I am taking rest in?
Who set The Great Library on fire and what happened to this Librarian? In DD you listened to a little story about boss encounter while loading screen. In ""Darkest Road"" you watch beautiful but  [u]absolutely unnecessary [/u] animations of  3D road and fight. 

Hero stories are  a great addition to the game by all means!

Hero relationships are an absolute miss (for me at least). [i]By the way, all first 4 heroes don't have positive relations artificially. I've tried 1st chapter with 2 new characters and - surprise, surprise - it was easy to build positive relations.[/i]

The problem is we've always only played these games multiplayer co-op and right now the multiplayer feels like an early beta mode. It's constantly crashing. It will randomly desync on the overland map, and it will get stuck and desync mid-battle. When we try to reload it brings us to a battle from several turns ago. Even using the ""revert"" function to restart at the beginning of the turn, it typically fixes the crashing (for a while) but sets us back 3 or 4 turns. We've spent just as much time trying to get the game to work as we have actually playing. We even tried the hotfix update but it hasn't resolved the issues.

I really do enjoy the new changes to how racial bonuses and tomes work. I think this game will be great when it's eventually patched, but with the current problems it's buggy and unplayable in multiplayer.",0

And seeing the current state just a week into Early access, this game is in very good condition compared to a few other encounters I have had. And if the devs keep up with their bug fixes, enhancements and whatnot, this is without a doubt a game that can entertain for a long while.

138027055,1550010,"Hello... I was looking for a Witch-friendly game. At the moment, you walk around the map and pick up stuff... no real reason or reward in doing so. In theory you can check a job board to do jobs for in-game Coins, however the Crops are Season Dependent... and you don't know what Season they Grow in... so I have spent what Coins I have on useless Seeds that don't grow.

Tools last about 4 uses and then are useless... you can't ""fix"" them, you spend in-game Coins on another about-to-break tool. The in-game days are so short- you wake up, make it about half-way across the Island and then it is Nighttime... shops are closed, you faint... and the day starts over gain.

This could be a fun game to play in about a year. The graphics are neat... you can go explore different things- but they are just ""things"" to look at... no reason to climb up a hill that has a wooden tower on it other than to just look down on the lake. All of the Witch's Spells/Powers/Rituals are ""locked""... there is not a ""light"" spell or anything that she can do... I've had this game for two weeks and other than running around and picking up Plants, Shells, Acorns... really ""nothing"" to do. 

Imagine Animal Crossing, however you can't ""Sell"" what you find, or really buy anything because you don't have a way to make more Currency. Occasionally you will get a Repetitive Quest- ""Collect 5 Seashells""... and you have enough time to go back to your HQ, get them and run as fast as you can to town to try and find whomever posted the Quest. There is no ""pointer""... to the quest giver, unless you are within a very short distance of them.

Some ""quests"" require a Certain Flower... and you have no way of knowing where on the Island they are... no suggestion, no ""pointer""... so you are just wandering the map hoping to stumble on whatever you need. I hope the Developers continue to improve it.",0

138113753,2396640,"TLDR:
The games systems run counter to it's level design, and this makes feel kind of awful. 

Long Version
The core of Catch the Fox’s gameplay is movement. It’s really the only thing you can do. Getting airborne gives you a speed boost on returning to the ground. This allows the player to skate merrily along. Or at least it would, if it wasn’t for a few issues.

The Foxes you need to touch have a hitbox for collisions that’s only slightly smaller then the hitbox for “touching” them. And when the player collides with them, they instantly lose all momentum. This absolutely kills any sense of pacing or chaining together multiple tags.
In addition, the players jump is miserable, capable of clearly a small section of environmental obstacles and absolutely nothing else. It’s not high enough to jump over foxes, or up to any interesting areas.

The levels themselves are not laid out in such as a way as to actually encourage use of the movement mechanics. One level, Fractal, while quite pretty has literally no capacity to gain speed or momentum, and might as well be flat once you reach the bottom layer.

Secondly, the other levels have been populated with a frankly ridiculous amount of what I’d politely call environmental chaff. The game is about touching foxes, not trying to touch foxes and slamming my wooden head into a tree every five inches.

The strongest level had none of these at all. It’s a great big sand-dune/ocean like thing of curving pits, that actually lets you leap around and gain speed. While not the most visually diverse, but that doesn’t matter, because this is a video game. It’s about the game mechanics, not the visuals.

Conclusion – For the Devs
You’ve made a movement based game where every aspect of the gameplay plays counter to that. Your level design doesn’t play with the surf and speed gain systems you’ve developed while almost all being cluttered with environmental garbage that appears to tank the frame rate. Your primary mechanic of tagging plays counter to that movement.

I liked the music, and there is a bit of zen feel to the game on levels like Ocean Outpost when I could get a flow going. But right now I just can't recomend this.",0

I'd probably max all of the achievements in it if I decided to keep it, but after 2h of demo and some playtesting I got really bored as there are a lot of similar games that are made better that are free on the internet, not to mention other more or less famous deckbuilding roguelikes this game competes with. To put it in comparison :

As of now this game sells for 139PLN, Made my math - You can buy 5-6 top tier viral deckbuilder roguelike games for that price if buying on sales/key shops/humble bundle, each of these cost 80PLN at most for the full price, a lot are selling for 30-50PLN. Cannot really spell them out, cause steam rules, just google ''top steam deckbuilding roguelikes'' and behold the goodness. There are literally dozens to choose from just from the newer ones.

I can understand that single devs and small teams put a lot of effort and love to make their products, but there is greedy, and there is Abalon, sorry for harsh words, I don't really mean to bully the dev, but but this price doesn't even make sense from marketing point of view. I am willing to bet my spare kidney, that it would sell for more if it was priced at its value, which is

",1
138095692,1940340,"Darkest Dungeon 2 departs from the hamlet-driven mechanics of the first game for more of a true roguelike experience. Each run is self contained, once you win or lose, you start from the beginning. During a run you collect candles; the persistent currency you spend at the end of runs to purchase items that will show up always in later runs, or to mildly buff heroes forever whenever you take them again. (One example is the Plague Doctor's first buff is +3% deathblow resistance)

The roguelike run structure is similar to other path-base games like slay the spire. You run into crossroads where you can choose which direction to go to face different challenges, battles, lairs, a place to rest, get some items, expand a heroes story, etc.

My favorite part of DD2 so far is the combat. It was great in the first game and it's still great here. I find it better mostly due to the new 3D models and animations, they are fantastic, weighty, and a pleasure to see, time after time.

Well at least for rather Solo-oriented Players a definitive not yet. The good is that it really can bring back some kinda feelings from good old C&C Renegade. The scale of things is just right, so that when you play ""a simple footsoldier"" you ARE a simple footsoldier with for example the Collectors being massive Vehicles digging into the ground.
The combat feels just simply ... okay, it is nothing breathtaking yet, while the AI for everything that you dont control is reaaaally wonky.
And this is one of the biggest Problems as of right now. The AI is just like the rest of the game reaaally bare bones stuff, pathfinding in Battle is just ... not good and f.e. the Collectors ahve quite some problems in positioning themself. Currently i dont think that having the ""massive scale"" of player amount will be the best but either way this will show itself over time.
Otherwise its just currently a bit ""not much"" content wise.

If you love PvP RTS with the chance of ""fighting in your own army"" dont pass up on this, BUT know that the AI isnt up to par yet.
If you are enjoying solo RTS in kind of a C&C style let the game cook a bit more in the oven.

138348060,1159690,"Its fun and and similar enough like RAFT, but has some glaring issues...

-Combat- 
Utterly abysmal, enemies are far too numbered, deal way too much damage, dont take enough damage and stagger you so much its very difficult to fight back. Spend an hour gaining resources for simple fights and its all gone in a few minutes. Skip fighting if you can, not worth it even with high tier weapons. 

-Fuel-
For a train game you'll spend alot of time at a crawl. Fuel is so inefficient, spend another hour gathering resources to fill up your maxed out diesel train and it will last maybe 5 minutes at full burn. Total waste. Same issue for most crafting stations and their fuel too. 

-Scaling-
There doesnt feel to be any scaling for different group sizes, solo this game is a chore sometimes. This goes into issues with combat and resources. Difficulty scaling is drastically needed or tweaked. 

-Research-
Research is linear and a total resource sink, making all the items you need for the thing only to waste it for the research, and with certain resources being rare this can hurt alot. 

-Progress and worlds-
The different paths and randomness is neat (and theres a bit of a way to manipulate them later on) but with certain resources only coming from a specific place and you needing a good amount...good luck getting the area to spawn when you want it to. (and with combat as bad as it is, its hard to get a good amount you'll find out as well) The story is interesting and comedic though. 

-Shark-
Whats its point...kill it at the start of every path and its not an issue till the next path. 

These are the only issues im having so far, theres alot of cool mechanics in the game, puzzle solving, loot chests (good luck fighting to open them though with the awful combat), workers, the aesthetic is super cool, I like buillding up the train. 

Overall im having ""fun"" but for a game thats been out for 2 years on Epic theres alot of issues still. I mean right after the steam release they JUST fixed an awful UI pain with building tools. Devs what are you doing? Get it together.

The game gives me strong The Sims 1 vibes, but in a slightly more pixelated sense. It's straight forward to play, nostalgic and the music is quite nice to listen to. However, although I say I recommend the game there are quite a few things that need work on:

- Constant music is nice, but it would be nice to either have an in-game radio or allow for custom music to be added as it does get repetitive.

- When Tinies go for a visit, can they please just wait outside to be allowed in? Currently they turn up and then help themselves to everything in the house (which isn't great if you have money issues and are surviving on leftovers) AND wake Tinies up as well.

- Why is it so difficult to get money? Jobs are good and all, but the bills that arrive on Friday... it's a lot no matter how small the house is. This needs a little looking into cause it seems that every time money comes in, it's gone again [i](Real life simulator ftw?)[/i]

- Leading on from this, do [b]not[/b] make a new family to add into the game if it is a Friday - you'll get sent some bills, and if you don't have the money available you will end up with the first week with no electric or water in the house.

- The needs need a little bit of reworking. The needs seem to be very specific at times (i.e. only comedy on TV brings up the fun quickly whilst other channels do it very slowly), and drain very quickly and are hard to fill back up.

- Currently there appears no way to be ""married"". You can set yourselves as dating, but when trying to make a family there is no marriage option. You can however imply it by having a child and selecting the other tinies as the parents.

As this is in early access, I understand that things are still getting worked on - and I really do enjoy life simulator games - and because I do see a lot of potential in this game, I've set this as ""recommended"" for now.

138008698,1515330,"Unfortunately I cannot recommend Monster Tribe, as in its current state it's a mess. 

First of all, it feels as if this game has an identity crisis. It wants to be an open world monster tamer with sandbox/resource gathering elements. None of these elements actually tie into each other beyond surface level connections though. Materials you harvest are only ever used to gate your progress, whether that be in the overarching plot of the game or gating you from getting new monsters. I only ever found myself harvesting resources when I absolutely needed to for the story. Even disregarding the fact that these elements of the game are disjointed though, these gameplay aspects just aren't compelling to play. Even if these game loops fed into each other I don't think I would make for a fun game, since the foundation itself is completely flawed. I want to break down my experience with each system the game presented, starting with the monster collecting and combat itself.

[h1] Monster Collecting and Combat [/h1]
Collecting new monsters in Monster Tribe is done by cloning them at these pause statues. At these statues you are presented a list of materials that are required to clone a new monster to add to your party. Like I said before, this just feels like a surface level solution to linking the resource gathering and monster collecting elements together. It aids neither system in any meaningful way, and actively hurts the monster gathering side of things. Doing things this way ends up completely mitigating any sense of discovery in finding new creatures. Sure, you don't know which creature you're cloning before you make it but by the time you have gathered everything you need you are already anticipating something new. There is no sense of surprise in finding any of the monsters while exploring, which would have really aided the open world aspect. 

That being said, I only interacted with this system when I played the demo. Nothing mechanically regarding it has changed since then, but the balance of battles is so completely in your favor that I realized I simply did not need any more monsters than my starter. I reached near the end of the fire area when I played, and only died once or twice. Even in group battles when it was 1 against 3 I would completely dominate. I didn't use any strategy either, I just attacked until either all the opponents fainted or I couldn't attack anymore, at which time I would rest so I could get enough attack points to finish the opponent off. It gets stale very fast and overall is very bare-bones. Something that honestly would have worked well would have been allowing items you collected to be used in battles, it would have been a pretty natural way to tie the gathering system in with the core game loop more while also allowing for more strategy on the player's side.

Another thing to note is that battles are extremely cluttered and hard to read, despite how stripped down they are gameplay-wise. Health bars, MP bars, and status effects are all extremely small and inconspicuous, taking a lot of active effort to read. It's just not very user friendly. 

There is potential in the battle system, I think the positioning aspect of battles is interesting, especially how some status effects are locked to the tile its used on rather than the monster the attack hits, but its also sadly completely underutilized and I never found it actually mattering in context.

[h1] Open World [/h1]
The open world aspect, much like the battle system, is very dry. It's very hard to do an open world well and Monster Tribe sadly falls flat in that department. It's only an open world to the extent that there are big open spaces to walk around in. There are these huge gaps of nothing but battle orbs floating around aimlessly that you have to walk between to get anywhere that actually progresses the story. That combined with the fact that the battles themselves just are not fun makes traversing more of a game of dodging as many battles as you can, then destroying the monsters you do end up having to encounter. To make an open world worth exploring you really need to include a wide variety of things to do in that space, and Monster Tribe provides the player with little to do besides walk from point A to point B. 

The only time I found something to do was when I encountered some Miners who gave me a quest to fix the minecart tracks by lighting some lanterns. Each rail required materials to fix. The loop boiled down to going to a rail, lighting the lantern, fixing the rail, doing it again until I didn't have enough resources to fix it, running around to try to find the resources I needed, then returning and doing it all over again. It was extremely boring.

[h1] Resource Gathering [/h1]
This is the decision I think not only drags the game down the most but I also genuinely don't understand the reasoning for its inclusion. There is so much in this game that is needlessly locked behind an arbitrary amount of resources. Want a new monster? Chop down 12 trees. Want to progress the story? Mine 15 rocks and catch 13 fish. It's such mindless busywork that I don't even understand adding it. Collecting resources itself is also a chore, you cannot hold down the input to break whatever you're harvesting, so you end up just sitting at a tree for 30 seconds mashing your keyboard until it falls down and then you can go do it all over.

There are also so many items you need to find and keep track of. Each of your tools (Axe, Pickaxe and Fishing Rod) have their own skill trees that require materials to upgrade. Each upgrade allows you to collect more materials. It is such a self contained system. These upgrades only serve to collect more resources and aren't present in any other aspects of the game from what I could see. The only time I ever found myself actively engaging in upgrades was when they game arbitrarily decided that to progress I needed some specific stone that required a better pickaxe to harvest. It's needlessly complicated as the upgrades effect very little besides this self contained system.

This is easily the most tedious aspect of the gameplay loop. I have nothing positive to say about it.

[h1] Miscellaneous Issues [/h1]
I have a bunch of other gripes that I'll just run through quickly now. 

[list]
[*] The game is just not good looking. I know graphics don't necessarily mean everything but without the gameplay to support it, the whole thing just falls flat. The Monster designs aren't compelling at all and all feel like first drafts, the player is generic, environments are bland, etc.
[*] The control schemes are genuinely baffling. You have three presets you can choose from. There are no rebindable controls. There are times where the game tells you to press the X button, which is actually the F key, which is just so confusing to the player. Controller inputs are also always shown along side keyboard inputs, even when not playing with a controller or even having one plugged in, which just ends up cluttering the already hard to read text even more.
[*] The start of the game is 10 minutes of solid reading. There is no attempt at diegetic tutorialization or storytelling, it throws mountains of hard to read text at you assuming you'd get it. 
[*] Menu's are completely incomprehensible most of the time, there's not nearly enough player feedback or clarity when navigating them and it ends up being overwhelming and frustrating.
[*] This game is 20 dollars?? I bought it for 15 and still feel kind of ripped off. I anticipate I'll be refunding it. 20 dollars for an indie game of this low quality is honestly unacceptable. 
[/list]

So no, unfortunately I cannot recommend this game. It ends up feeling like a concept built solely off of buzzwords like ""Open World Resource Harvesting Monster Catcher"". There is no foundation of a solid game present, all the systems are for the most part self contained and super tedious, and the overall experience is extremely unpleasant.",0

138246390,1669000,"This game has basically been my introduction into the franchise and I gotta say... I'm enjoying it quite a bit. It reminds me a bit of Heroes of Might and Magic 5 in some ways with your heroes and armies and the tile based, turn based combat system.

The graphics are pretty good, I get the feeling there might be some balancing issues, but.. I don't know what they may or may not be since everything seems powerful in its own right.

The customization of your faction is absolutely amazing, I love it, 10/10. My only issue is I wish there was more customization and some of the traits seem more powerful than others in terms of gameplay. One common trait I seen taken up is Overwhelming Tactics, since a 20% buff to crit chance is pretty nutty, ngl. I get the feeling the game is going to get more fleshed out over time in terms of customization, kind of like how Stellaris was fleshed out more and more by DLCs. 

The combat is pretty tight and the music.. awww man the music. It really does a great job of setting the tone. I really want to hear more of this composer's work. The battles where you are uncertain of the outcome and fields of trampled grass plays.. mmmm so good.

I hope the devs listen to criticism and take some things to heart.

My recommendation is buy the game, try it out for about 2 hours and decide if you like it or not. If you don't you can always get a refund via Steam's refund policy. I've been hooked onto it, and I hope to see this game grow and change into something greater over time. 

---------

Now I'd like to address some of the complaints and negative reviews I've seen. Mainly from the old timer AOW players. I want to go over just a couple complaints and then respond to them.

Things they don't like:

1. Racial Identity is non-existent. The common claim is that races are just amorphous blobs, stripped of any identity, but I think that is kind of the point. You are given the creative freedom to mold and shape your own unique race based on racial attributes, culture, societal traits, tomes, and more! You want Angelic barbaric warrior halfings, go nuts! You want to engage in some Nature oriented Heavy Industry Elves, have at it! You want some Frozen Orc Paladin holy orders running around, heck yeah! The race itself has the identity you choose to give it, rather than it being pre-defined. With the customizations in place you can have oh so much variety and options in your playstyle. It opens more doors than it closes. More playstyle variety. Take for example Orcs in AOW3. They got +5 health +1 Melee ATK -1 Ranged ATK (Going from an example I saw in a post, this could be inaccurate) This naturally gears those orcs to a specific playstyle of melee oriented. This is very restrictive, if you want to play ranged you can, but its already putting you behind the other factions. In AOW4, you can easily swap traits for the build you want. In AOW4 you could give your orcs Keen-sighted and give them a 30% accuracy on ranged attacks, so you could live out your wild orc hunters fantasy, or expert longbow orcs, whatever really.  I think its a rather boring world where every orc is exactly the same, every halfling is exactly the same, every human, every elf, etc. etc. More customization is never a bad thing in my opinion. Variety is the spice of life, as they say.

2. Micromanagement removal. From what I've read, a lot of old AOW players are mad that a bunch of micromanagement elements were taken out, like Settlers for example. Honestly, they can ditch that stuff if you ask me. Getting rid of micromanagement makes the game more accessible to new players. Reason being, it doesn't have as steep of a learning curve to 'git gud' at it. I love RTS and TBS games, but they do have learning curves to them, steeper than ones in say.. an FPS game. The more micromanagement you add to it, the steeper the learning curve becomes and the less appealing it is to new players to get into. I, personally, don't like to micromanage every little detail, I don't need to personally touch every single grain of rice my farmers farm. (Exaggeration, but you get my point lol.) There's a reason the term micromanagement is typically associated in a bad light, its tedious and most of the time, not enjoyable, but.. apparently not the case with AOW oldheads.

3. No unique racial units. This has been addressed by many before. Culture wasn't a thing back in previous iterations of AOW. Racial units have been moved over to Culture, so you still have the racial units just under a different name and thus giving you even more diversity of your chosen units. A Ratfolk Berserker, Human Berserker, and dwarf Berserker might all be different based on their Mind/Body traits. Hell the Ratfolk berserker might be more skirmishy, weaving in and out of the fight to hit weakened targets. The Human berserker might rank up faster and still do massive damage even when half the units are whacked. The dwarf berserker might be extraordinarily tough and fight in formation with other dwarven berserkers leading to a +3 bonus in their total defenses making them extraordinarily tanky frontliners. The racial traits can be swapped at faction creation too so you can have all manner of unique and interesting combinations and playstyles!

Like it or not, change is happening. It seems the devs want to simplify things somewhat so new players can get engaged with the series and with this engagement.. you get more players who will potentially look at the previous titles and give them a shot and then make their own judgement calls.

With a lot of the hate and vitriol some old timers are spewing in the discussions and reviews section, I think I'd rather stay away from AOW3 and its predecessors given how toxic these people are coming across. I get it, I really do. This feeling of spite and anger, that's what I feel towards World of Warcraft and Overwatch. Games that had better times in their past and changed for worse in present day. That doesn't mean change isn't good, it just isn't what we want. Overwatch and WoW made changes that made it easier for newer players to get into, which is basically what AOW4 is doing. It's going to alienate the oldtimers but bring in some fresh blood. Face it, you just don't like change, even if its beneficial because you're set in the old ways. I get it, I really do.

At the time of this review its sitting at an 83% positive (Which is 2% greater than AOW3 :P) They must be doing something right, but only time will tell if this changes. For now, I stand by this review. It's a good game in my opinion.",1
138105924,1294810,"It's Far Cry 5 with loot, vampires and odd graphics (seriously, the people look weird). If that sounds fun to you, check it out. It's nowhere near as bad as the internet dog-piling would have everyone believe. I've had a lot of fun exploring Redfall.",1
138346834,758690,"The game follows the same vibes of The Long Drive, totally different genre, but it uses the same procedural spawn of random bases everywhere, using different seed values gives you different loot / base configurations spawned.

It is very addictive when you learn how to grind in a good way, it takes a few Restarts to get a good start, if you take too long to figure things out you will run out of food, but it can be totally avoided if you learn how to play.

Basically just git gud.

I hope they keep adding new features, theres a lot of systems that would benefit from being inspired by other games like Space Engineers and Stationeers, specially the Electrical department, devs please take a look on how these other games deal with batteries and distribution. :D

Overall, it is a very fun game, with very low graphics and it is highly addictive. :D",1

138095300,1159690,"Like Raft, you're on a base floating through a sea of junk that you can pull in to build up your base. 

Unlike raft, you have a narrator yacking in your ear and assuming the worst of the player's intelligence, connecting dots for you. I really do not see the need for a narrator in any survival crafting game, as the crux of these games are meant to be immersion and experimentation. I think it would be better if the narrator was potentially replaced by an NPC that gives you advice or could be toggled off.

Going back to the experimentation, there is a research line (not a tree, it's a single line) that the game *tries* to be helpful with an give quests to walk through it. It feels a little condescending, and again, having it be optional would be better.

The final mark for me is the lighting. there is no flashlight, so when it gets dark, you either have to crank the brightness to see, or fumble in the dark. This was very apparent when I ended up at an outpost on a path that was set at ""night"" and I just could not see the enemies at all  until I boosted the brightness and made it look like an oldtimey movie night scene.

There's also an awkwardness when playing on controller that the radial menus imply using an analog stick to point in the direction of the item you wish to use/build. when using a particular UI layout, you should follow what is expected of that layout. However, the most glaring part of the UI is the steam engine. When you attempt to select a item to use for the steam engine, you would expect to use the d-pad for selection as everything else does. *This is not the case.* UI elements, when similar in form, should work the same same way.

I won't be recommending this *for now* but we'll have to see what the future brings.

For the Devs:
- add a flashlight or more ambient light
- standardized UI functionality (radial menu selection with analog, the steam engine)
- a ""hands off"" mode that let's the player organically discover the research and story.",0

I effectively need to play with a game guide open just to understand what's happening in combat. Some of the out of combat interfaces also aren't explained or obvious what you can do on them. 
Combat itself is...fine. It's frustrating and confusing due to the above and isn't enough to make up for the rest of the game.",0
138348817,758690,"One of the most promising survival RPG out there.
TDLR: Try it, refund if unhappy but give it a chance. Consider trying the demo(occupy mars: prologue 2020) at least.
Especially if you are a space exploration nerd like me. I love the idea and I really like their dedication to realistic Sci-Fi. 
Think ""The Expanse""(without the torch drives) instead of Star Trek magic tech. Or SpaceX in 20-30 years.

Explore, grow your food, expand your base, unlock new technologies and ultimately becomes self-sufficient.  Get the full martian colonist experience including freezing to death in those cold martian nights, eating a meteor to the face, losing the war against sand and breaking your neck while attempting a front flip with your ATV in 40% earth gravity.

Game is stable I haven't had a crash so far. There are a few hiccups with the game but nothing major. I should point out that 4 patch have been published in less than a week since launch so some bugs that were present on launch day are already gone(infinite loading in particular). Thus the game is not as broken as some early reviews would lead you to believe. 

The game is fun but a number of issues(big&small) remain: 

The soundtrack is fine but the game will occasionally cycle from one track to the next without rhyme or reason, as far as I can tell. That can be a bit jarring at times. It's also a little repetitive. I wish we had more control over that.

The performance is okay but it's somewhat lower than the play test(pre-early access) for one reason or another(it could be the different location on the map). I used to get low to mid 90's now I currently get high 70's to low 80's on average with dips to 40's or sometimes 30's when on the QUAD ATV. Given my high spec system(5900x/32gb ram/3090), it is mildly disappointing to see occasional stutters when there were none previously(or very few) but it is also early access. To be fair, I maxed out all the graphics settings so the game would run better if I were to lower a few.

While most of the core features are in the game, they still need to add a number of things so optimisations will likely take some time, which is fine. Adding DLSS support would be nice. 

The datapad fetch quests is rather boring. I am not convinced that datapads should be required for basic technologies. In the game you are purportedly an electrical engineer, yet, you need to rediscover how to extend/upgrade the ECU/batteries? Seems odd to me. Also, far too grindy. This is a fine balance though. If it becomes too easy then players will blitz through the tech tree and skip some of the techs but right now given how rare datapads are, I think some techs should have that requirement waved. It also forces us to reload the game if we don't get the tech we need so overall the experience is janky. Sure it's self-inflicted to a point but trust me, you REALLY want those battery upgrades and as it stand finding a sufficient amount of datapad in a reasonable time-frame is too hard. I found 3 datapads after being 6 hours in the campaign(which is not worth it right now, just do freeplay).

The system should be modified such that you still need datapads to progress toward mid & late game techs but for the technologies you need to build a basic self-sufficient base you should be able to get them without datapads. So essentially, a workshop that can power itself and produce food in perpetuity. One might think that you don't truly need the ecu and battery upgrade to do this but I disagree because of the circuits board requirement. You need at least 48hours of battery capacity and assuming a drain of 25 kw, that's a lot of batteries.~14 circuit boards or 1 per 90kwh of capacity provided by un-upgraded batteries, +3-4 for ecu, +1 for ATV. Just not realistic to expect player to obtain that many small circuit boards in the early game. Why 48 hours? Dust Storms. Solar panels produces nothing during storms and run at a lower rate for some time after unless you clean them.  Probably want 72 hours of capacity to be extra safe. Thankfully, upgrades for ecu and batteries don't need circuits board which seems reasonable to me. Just be really careful with those potato seeds and don't plant them too early.

[b]Speaking of circuit boards, Please Devs, make them stackables[/b]. Also, let us store them in the containers in the capsule and give us containers for the workshop too.

The distribution of circuit boards on the map is strange. I have found 7 large ones, about the same amount of small ones but only one medium circuit board. This might be fine depending on which devices need which circuit board(something which the knowledge base in the game doesn't cover at the moment), so time will tell. 

Some techs should be shifted around. Why is suit battery printing so far up the tech tree? It's weird. But again, early access and things already changed substantially from the previous version so I expect that things will keep changing according to feedback.

I dislike the new procedure to remove the helmet too many clicks are involved( I use the keybind instead) but more importantly, there should be an option to speed up or skip the animation. First person animation for helmet removal and when going to sleep would be nice... 

The biggest issue in my opinion is that the campaign is not very good right now. You should just play the tutorials on the main menu and then do free play. Here's why:
The facial animation don't seem to always work or maybe not every character has animation one, I'm not sure. The more important issue though it's that the whole story intro at alpha base feels rushed and it seems like it's just tacked on. You very briefly get introduced to some characters and some of the basic mechanics without it being a full blown tutorial and then complete three or four basic tasks which at the same time don't teach you anything immediately useful. Then the base gets blown up everyone either leaves or dies and you are left alone on mars. After that, you start just like you would if you had selected free play. 

Another issue is that while after the base gets destroyed, you need to escape it and it's an absolute maze which would be fine if not for the fact that if you run, jump or move too quickly in some corridors(the ones with collapsed roof or missing floors mainly) you die instantly. Escaping it was a lot of trials and errors. Even before the base gets destroyed, navigating through it was a pain since a lot of airlocks are locked for no apparent reason and you often need to take a massive detour to get where you need to go.  There are also no sign post anywhere so finding the doctors office for example is just a matter of opening every door in the general direction that the arrow points towards. I like the general idea but the intro needs a lot of polish.  I am not sure if there are currently more story related content beyond that but I will update my review If I find any. 

There are a few other issues and a little jank( no crosshair or target highlight when grinding/mining/repairing, pop-in of your face while driving the ATV, no map while driving the ATV) but this review is getting quite long.  

All in all though, the Devs have good ideas and a good work ethic if the incredible patch cadence is any indication and I imagine the issues will get fixed sooner or later. 

In short, a good albeit not perfect early access game but a solid 7/10. If we get everything that's been alluded to on the roadmap it will easily be be 9/10. If you are on the fence, try out the demo that was released a while back. Failing that, buy it, try out the tutorial and freeplay for an hour or two and if you don't like it refund it but I really think you should give them a chance.

Skip the campaign for now though as it will just waste your time and not give a good overview of the rest of the game.

There's some cheeky humour and a fairly good open world to explore. Players take the role of a  ""bum"" who struggles to speak well and has a mate whos been turned into a shopping trolley with big googly eyes. He's your guide and Its revealed that you're missing like, half your brain or something due to an experiment and now you have to  get to the bottom of it. But its going to take time so in the mean time, you need to stay alive to keep going

You will need to write your own cardboard sign, beg for money, go through garbage to find left over food and drink to survive. However, It doesn't take long to learn that this bum you're playing as must have been some kind of super brainy dude or something, As the very element of survival is eliminated when you discover the crafting/base building of the game. For a bloke with half a brain,  you have no problems making stable structures out of cardboard, wood or even left over metal. This bum you're playing as has an uncanny knack to be extremely resourceful! 

You could beg for money or if you put a bit of effort, you could recycle some materials found from rubbish piles and other various areas, eventually create a garden bed and grow a range of veggies, cook them with a variety of recipes from the top of your head,  sell them all off to a pawn dealer and make hundreds of dollars within minutes. There is never a need to beg again. This covers your food too but if you do need food and drink? Punch or kick a vending machine and boom. You're full.  Not complaining, but if the game was to be about surviving the streets, it's probably missed that result and It certainly feels more like ""Thriving on the streets""

Not sure how far I am in this game but I'm currently walking around with hundreds of dollars just by doing this simple method of rinse and repeat.  Also, This bum is highly innovative in home security. You can create turrets and landmines to stop other bums from raids. You can even employ other bums with smokes to go fetch materials too!  

Catch is, with the open world mechanic and a fairly wide depth of stuff to create for your home, even for decorating or money making purposes. Its actually a really fun game. The mystery of whats happened is fun to explore and managing your health, food and drink meters is easy to fix giving you some freedom to explore the city at your own pace.  I'd recommend it but looking forward to seeing the ridiculously large and sustainable mansions made of cardboard by the steam community.",1

138060857,1651490,"Keep in mind that this game JUST released in Early Access. It is not complete. In the game's current state, Tiny Life plays a lot like a watered-down Sims game, which is great. It's the most similar to the first game. I think I (like a whole bunch of other people who are flocking towards this game, I'm sure) got burnt out on literally thousands of hours of the Sims over the course of my life and I was looking for something new to scratch that itch. The art style is so cute, and so are the music and sound effects. I was having a good time trying out the different skills, interactions, and careers. There is not much of a sense of progression when you accumulate more wealth as you cannot buy more expensive furniture or move-- YET. These are planned for later updates and I knew that when I bought and downloaded Tiny Life in EA. 

If you don't like the gameplay of the Sims, you will not like this one either. I disagree that the characters don't have personality. I think it's really funny having randos coming to my house and the babies demanding strangers to do things for them. The AI is also excellent, maybe a little too good, which is not a critique I was expecting to have. The game can pretty much play itself if you let it, quickly queuing up tasks to meet their needs. They're not going to die from neglect if you ignore them, which can be a real challenge in the Sims. I might suggest a slider to give them more or less autonomy to combat that so it flows smoother in multi-person households. All this to say: I think games like Tiny Life and the Sims give you the backbone to have fun, and then you need to be creative with storylines to keep it engaging. You don't have a direction or tasks to guide you; you make it up. At best, you have mini goals for the careers and life time wishes, on top of keeping them satisfied. I don't see this as an issue with the game. Just think about what kind of games you like before buying. Do you like a story, fleshed out characters, and clear goals to work towards? Tiny Life prob isn't for you. And that's fine. It doesn't make it a bad or boring game... this is kind of like the polarizing opinions Minecraft gets. 

I love that smaller devs are getting into making life simulator games and giving EA (the bad one... Electronic Arts) some much needed competition. I am so excited to see how this game and Paralives continue to grow and I'm going to keep checking back in and playing with the content updates! Play this for $15 instead of spending hundreds on all the Sims expansions, stuff packs, and what are we on now- game packs? It's nuts. Your efforts to make this game are much appreciated from this Simmer. Best wishes, Ell. 

I'll probably come back and update this review later if I remember to!!",1
138046522,1651490,"Tiny Life is a game that easily takes a lot of notes from classic series that is The Sims, originally crafted by Will Wright and having been published by Electronic Arts (formally it was Maxis who overlooked the series before it was shut down by EA in 2015) over the decades (for better or for worse), and seeks to recreate the experience by going back to it's origins, making the gameplay matter more like it did in the earlier entries whilst still taking some 'Quality of Life' updates that said earlier games lacked, all whilst putting a unique spin on it's world that separates it from it's obvious inspiration.

Noting that this is an early impression of this game, having reviewed it just 6 days after it's initial release on the 3rd of May 2023, so a lot of the content and gameplay mechanics that are present here (alongside those that are not) will likely have changed to some degree over the coming months and years, so bear this in mind when reading further into this review.

No doubt what will catch many people's attention right off the bat is the graphics, seeing how The Sims has always been a 3D game by heart, having originally been designed as a 'doll house' simulator of sorts but later becoming more about the people living inside of it that were given the apt name of 'Sims' after simulated people, whereas Tiny Life scales back the graphics to a more simplistic 2D retro pixelized style which, to be fair, does have it's own charm that, with enough time, can flourish and take on a fun new life of it's own!

As far as the actual gameplay itself goes, Tiny Life keeps things fairly straightforward as fans of the genre will easily be able to pick up many of the distinct feature of a Sims-like game without needing to refer to a guide for clarification, seeing as the goal of Tiny Life is essentially whatever you want it to be, whether to gain as much money and wealth as possible, having a whole host of friends to be the popular person in town with, fashioning up your Tiny to be the most stylish in town alongside a beautiful home to boot or just simply creating a lookalike version of you and your family and let them do their own thing to see how it all plays out!

Although this is a problem that is evident due to it's early release, I was somewhat disappointed to see that some features iconic to The Sims franchise are not present in Tiny Life, although I imagine these will be added in patches following this review. Some of the things that I noticed were missing that people interested in this game may want to be made aware of are as follows:

• The option to marry other Tinies
• Phones to call other Tinies to chat/invite them as well as to receive random phone calls from others
• Random events that occur within your house (Burglars, raccoons, earthquakes etc)
• Option to add floors or create a basement within boundaries of property
• Being able to move from one small lot to a larger one once enough wealth has been accumulated

Alongside a lot of item categories feeling a little lackluster (noting that this is still early in this game's release, so this will likely change as a priority to giving more depth and expanding on the differences between poor Tinies and wealthy ones) and not featuring more quality items at a premium price, I feel that this could prove a problem for some who are looking for a more in-depth type of simulation experience although I personally have hopes that the developer, with the right support and funds from initial backing, will be able to expand on this over time.

Generally speaking, as far as the game's challenge goes, I get the impression that Tiny Life is more aimed at casual gamers than the older times (1 & 2 come to mind, with how achieving that 'ideal life' was FAR from easy and made you work for it by highly optimizing what you did in the entire lifespan of your chosen sim!) of before, seeing how the advanced AI for this game, assuming you allow it on from the settings, can easily play by itself and choose their own careers, build their own skills (of which there are 13 currently) and generally lead a fulfilling life without any interaction needed from the player. Some may view this as a poor reflection on actual simulation games although I quite like the more laidback nature of it, as the game's wholesome approach to the Tinies gives off the impression it was always meant to be a more casual game of sorts.

It helps that this game takes The Sims 4's emotions system and works upon it in such a way that it at least manages to integrate itself more meaningfully into the gameplay mechanics of Tiny Life, seeing as there are both positive effects to be had (Focused/Energetic allows Tinies to build up certain skills faster and Creative tends to results in higher quality items for production-based skills) as well as negative effects (Uncomfortable prevents Tinies from doing certain useful tasks and Embarrassed/Angry makes interacting with other Tinies more difficult as a result of their mood) that can impact the lifestyle of your Tinies, with how this can be impacted both by decisions that they/you make alongside certain objects that boost their mood in a (hopefully!) more positive light leading to more productive behaviours.

In conclusion, I would recommend Tiny Life to those looking for a Sims-like experience that takes a bold new direction with it's graphics alongside trying to replicate the older experiences in some ways whilst also keeping the good changes that later entries of The Sims would bring forth, however caution is advised for those expecting a full-fledged game as I would say to wait at least a good 6-12 months to have some of the game's content expanded upon once people have played it thoroughly and given the right suggestions to the developer to further add onto this wonderful game!

TLDR Version:

• A great recreation of Electronic Arts' iconic 'The Sims' series that is faithful to the core gameplay principles (+)
• Tiny Life gives the Sims-like experience in a simple-yet-enjoyable retro pixel 'demaster' graphics take suitable for the indie scene (+)
• Excellent AI that goes beyond what is expected and can just about fully function entirely on their own without any interaction needed from the player if they desire a 'hands-off' approach (+)
• Plenty of choice for colours of furniture, floors and walls alongside clothing to fully customize your Tinies and their ideal home (+)
• Achievements, although few, will give players a sense of direction for more creative challenges that made The Sims so fun to mess around with (+)

• Currently there is little in the way of item progression, with few items being available and some outright missing, but this will likely change in the coming months as it progresses further from it's release date (-)
• Surprisingly the only way to die in Tiny Life is through either old age or starvation, no iconic deaths by fire, drowning or electrocution among others (-)
• The challenge aspect of this game is unfortunately lacking, as attaining the 'ideal life' for your Tiny is nowhere near as brutal as it was in earlier Sims entries (-)
• Due to certain functions set in stone in The Sims not currently being present in Tiny Life, trying to create wacky and chaotic experiences may prove difficult until more is added to the game (-)",1

It's clear how much time and effort went into aspects of this game. The environmental storytelling sells that charm. The small space to work with creating a challenge - Something that is just gorgeous to play. Something that is still being developed and loved, something that is just fun. 

That narrator has my heart. Destroying defenceless creatures for their resources. Just being able to swim around in an open void.

Recommended. I cannot wait to see how much further this game could go with more time.",1
138096027,1159690,"Everything that is an EGS exclusive comes out on steam sooner or later. Voidtrain is one of them.
I read the reviews, the game scolded for various bugs and dampness, but wait, the game is in early access, it is written on the page and you are still notified about it when you start the game!  I've played so far only an hour and a half and have not encountered any bugs. Someone didn't like the shooting, but I was pleasantly surprised her. It is quite at the level. Although I have only shot so far with a gun. Who scolds the collection of resources and crafting... Seriously? This is a survivalist, this is the essence of the game! In general, I do not understand the complaints of players.
I played solo, in the co-op until lez. The game is a mix of Raft game and the movie Snowpiercer. Graphically it looks very unpretentious, even with some kind of Cel-shaded effect, and the game is made on UE4, but okay, sorry, it's an indie game. Create your character, the choice is very poor, but it's not so important. We have a small platform, which rushes through space on rails, we can go forward, we can go backward, or stop altogether. As in Raft, while driving we collect various resources, with which we craft other resources and build workbenches, improve your future carriage. We can not fly away, because tied to the rope to its platform, there is no gravity. At intervals, will meet the station, which we investigate for weapons, recipes and resources. 
There is a lot of crafting here, I even got tired when making a simple bandage. We need to do something about it, to simplify the steps.
When approaching the first station, I was impressed by the soundtrack. I thought there was some kind of danger, perhaps waiting for me to fight, such was the tension in the music, I liked it :)
In steam, the page with the game have screenshots and videos where we fight the monsters already built a train, man, it's cool, I do not know if it's all in the early access, but what I played, I liked it.

In this game will not return soon, because it is in early access, and I do not like survival in early access, as after any updates break the save or my world, have to start over. I have this experience with Rust. So I'm waiting for the full release.

138092404,1940340,"The game is great, don't listen to those clown negative reviews and here a few reasons why.

1. The people complaining it's a rogue like now and not the long campaign that DD1 was. --- The game has been out on Epic for OVER a year now and the devs were very open about DD2 being a more rogue like and focusing on shorter run times. You had plenty of time and opportunities to educate yourself on the type of game this would be but yet you didn't. That's a you issue.

2. The people who have like .5 hrs played on steam but say they ""put in over 70 hours on the Epic Store"" so ""I know what I'm talking about."" --- What? You put in OVER 70 hours of the game on the Epic Store, KNEW you didn't like the game, and then continued to buy the game on Steam just so you could leave a negative review? Sure, buddy, sure. 

The game is great. Your first run is probably going to be rough until you learn the ins and outs of the systems and each subsequent run becomes just a lil bit easier as you unlock things through the candles system. Just stick with it and you'll enjoy it I promise.",1
138064958,1155330,"Had a blast playing, but I wish I had put the game on a harder difficulty than ""normal"". I seemed to breeze right through *most* fights without much challenge on the normal difficulty. The music is definitely a highlight, I believe people from the music teams of cyberpunk and The Witcher 3 composed the soundtrack.
The theme of the game is a little odd, Showgunners doesn't take itself too seriously, but also wants to keep a SERIOUS story. It works for what it is, but it feels mildly out of place at times... my opinion may change on a second playthrough if I decide to do so. 7.75/10

138369614,1566200,All in all the core is here. They really need to work on stability throughout the playthrough and balancing of the bosses.

You are “slim pickings” Johnny, the midnight shift attendant of the Quick Stop who falls prey to the drive-by of yellow van and a prank caller. Are the two related? What did that one lady have before coming there?? Does he at least get minimum wage??? Find out in…! 


[h1] ! ANNOUNCEMENT ![/h1]
This review breaks my hiatus of two- nearing three weeks, the last game I reviewed just broke my spirit because it got me thinking that horror games are running out of ideas… and why [b]Renaissance Pictures[/b] hasn’t taken action is beyond me!

Also, my birthday is in two days (10th May), and I know I usually keep mundane news of this sort to myself; but I want to try to be more candid and connect with anyone who reads my stuff. Thank you very much~


[h1][u][+] PROS;[/u][/h1]

[h1]:) FRANK AND HIS BINS *GRUMBLES*[/h1]
If you’ve given [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadeGuard98/recommended/1228520/] The Convenience Store[/url] a whirl, this experience of manning a gas station alone while catering to every busywork expected of a meagre salaryman should come as second nature. The biggest difference? It’s a short but sweet slasher with it taking partial inspiration from[b]Poop Killer[/b] and the remainder from [b]Stay Out of The House’s[/b] opening segment; and like you, it works, surprisingly!

Get off the bus, replace your coworker, stock the shelves, operate the till, maintain the cleanliness of the premises, survive a gradually skulking killer who gets off on tormenting already sad workers, and y’know… the usual. Since it’s NOT your first day on the job, some things don’t get explained to you, but that’s all good since some of us get paid to sit around anyway; totally reasonable.

The shift should take up to 1 hour at most- best job in the world, right? It has just one outcome and that’s finding employment somewhere else… Or just don’t work at all, because no one has ever been terrorized from within their homes. Goodness, I just gave the idea for a sequel, didn’t I~

[u]TIPS:[/u]
1) Loop around the gas pumps for the final showdown!
2) Hiding (other than the locker) is plain useless.


[h1]:) OFF-BRAND AT ITS- UMM, IT’S SOMETHING![/h1] 
If you’re like me, you love any form of entertainment where the entirety of it revolves around a singular location and this delivered that good! You have all shift to familiarize yourself with the layout of the blasé space that is the inside of the store cause you don’t know when a life-threatening situation might break out in that false sense of security… Staring blankly outside the glass at the almost always vacant area where the pumps stand save for the traffic that zooms past or when the occasional customer decides to make a turn in.

The well-lit but lifeless workplace is essentially a bug-zapper… only for humans. Sure, it’s attractive and provides warmth, but it’s only a matter of time! The clientele has seen better days too, but at least they take your mind off the monotony. And speaking of, the silence grows ever more deafening when you’re hard at work, and so you make your own music with the amount of traipsing around to and fro the counter and the ding-chime of the automated door to warn you that break time’s over. Broken only by the faint intrusion from the radio blaring 80-90s slasher-esque tunes that really remind you of the genre you’re in~


[h1]:) SHIFT. HAPPENS. AND GAS WHO…? YUP, NOT-SO-GROSSFACE!!![/h1]
The plot isn’t as riveting as that of a whodunnit nor is it invested in giving the killer an elaborate backstory… Both, however, still lend themselves towards a solid “wrong place at the wrong time” setup, flaws be damned! Let’s be real, we just want to be scared when it comes to these things, and its shelves are lined with every horror movie trope that you can think of! From a writer’s favorite location to the progression and even the ultimate face-off. The characters aren’t complex or developed killer fodder, but I’ll take it! Mindless thrills evocative of age-old franchises, some of which are still alive and kicking today! And for 2 bucks? I’d say money well spent~


Want to know what really made me lose my marbles? It wasn’t the killer… per se, but rather the sheer serendipity of it all. That, and I also thought about all the horror films I gratuitously indulged in, ones that prominently featured or had at least one token appearance of gas stations as killing areas! I found myself waiting for scares that never arrived, and spooked by ones I didn’t see coming, of which there were a few alright! Whereas The Convenience Store was mostly supernatural in terms of its dread, here it’s all man-made and the setting itself a quiet non-literal killer!

And to be on the receiving end of one of them dastard obscene phone calls WHILE within a video game is pretty chilling albeit only being in text form! I would know, because I very recently freaked myself out so thoroughly with my own impersonations of [url=https://youtu.be/RtOLA58vPt0/] Ghostface[/url] which evidently the developer is a fan of for sure from the design and behavior of the antagonist~


[h1][u][-] CONS;[/u][/h1]

[h1]:( DIDN’T REALLY HANDLE IT SHELF WELL, BUT EH![/h1]
The humor injected in the title was so disproportional that I fail to see what the supposed end game of that was meant to be…! My first playthrough, I chalked it up as painful and on my second- just an easter egg (not even to a great entry btw) that sorely misses. The only other reason I can think of is that it did so solely for the sake of differentiating itself from its peers of gas station horrors.

The dev himself has fessed up as being abundant, but THIS isn’t how you do it! It didn’t help that the English made it comical too. Plus, I felt the absence of voice-acting for the killer really hurt it, and no, I don’t want it to just have a carbon copy of Ghostface, but at least have a unique-sounding mascot. I mean, it’s super hard to really be unsettled by just a disembodied voice spouting out gibberish~
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973132127


[h1]:( GETTING STOCKED HAS NEVER BEEN SO BORING...[/h1]
For a game real self-aware by how many similar titles on the market, it did insanely little to address the shortcomings from the others. I’m talking wonky triggers for the scares, abysmal player signposting, prompts to be done at just the exact spot, and the end product? A ton of waiting around which I’m sure actual workers of these joints do, but that’s not the issue. It missed out on some clever moments that would’ve fully capitalized its slasher identity and the ending was a cheap cop-out~


[h1]BUGS:[/h1]
x Automated door didn’t open for some clients.
x The killer AI isn’t very smart and yet sometimes it is TOO smart. 
x Clients walk down the edge of sidewalk all funny XD


[h1]NITPICKS:[/h1]
~ Bullet sponge final boss doesn’t react to shots...
~ Would be nice if there is a “no progress will be saved” disclaimer; apart from the last trial-and-error encounter I mean.

[u]Last Words?[/u]
Cut and dried slasher whose tone could’ve been dialed up way higher if not held back by amateurish slip-ups at both pacing and uneventful humor. Does the job satisfactorily, and is well worth a stop~

138058720,2395260,"Midnight Shift has the most dramatic clogged toilet entrance you will ever see, Bollywood is in awe.

Another game about working nightshift at a gas station, what could go wrong? What I really liked here is the intro sequence, the protagonist walking from the bus station to the gas station, the camera zooms in, and woosh, you are him. Unfortunately that also foreshadows how this game will mainly play, slow and stretched out. 

You have your basic mundane tasks, which are not mundane enough, as they can be completed in quick succession, leaving you to stand around dumbfounded, waiting for the next phone call or customer appearence to happen. This procedure of waiting usually takes a few minutes and will repeat and repeat. Do small thing, wait. There is also no sprint, so everything is even slower... it took 45 minutes until some action started, and when you are at the good part, its over before you know it. 1 hour foreplay with one strong thrust at the end and its all over, some may call this build up, but to me its sadly only a waste of time.

Compressing this into half of its length, and adding a sprint would make this a far better experience, as it stands I can not recommend it, except you look for something more relaxing.

Thank you Shatter Glass games, for providing me with a copy, much appreciated!

ability to remove the staff/wand for a shield and not the sword,
Healing Stops every 6 or 9 rooms,
Ability to upgrade gear with more then one stat,
and arrow on the screen to show the current span location of room, 
unstuck button that will bring you to the starting location of the room (gods my toon got stuck so many times),
clear visibility of Enemy attack, as of now, if you trip them and walk over them they still hit you for some reason,
even if it shows they are stunned,

It's not huge and involved like XCOM, but I think these kind of 2-AP systems fit a smaller game like this far better. The balancing also works fairly well because you really have to leverage your team's full skill-set.

How does it come that so many people are posting negative reviews, because they expected a slighty altered version of the first game? 

Darkest Dungeon II has been out in [i]early excess[/i] for over a year already, so there are tons of videos and streams online to check if it suits your taste. Also the game got at least two [i]gameplay[/i] trailer, as well as Red Hook Studios themself communitcated clearly, that they wanted to try a different approach to their world, characters and mechanics. They did exactly that. Nothing more, nothing less.

So my question is, how could it happen, that some people are still surprised to find out, that Darkest Dungeon 2 is totally different from the first one?
It was clear from the start. 
You don't have to like it, but don't blame the dev's for trying something new, while not reading even a tiny bit about the product yourself, before buying it. Its your own fault if you buy something while knowing nothing about the product, but a name.

Darkest Dungeon II itself is a [i]fine game[/i]. It looks great, performs well enough and introduced lots of new mechanics (some are more welcome than others, thats for sure), which would not have worked in the hub-managing style of the first game. Overall its just as stressing as the first one. Maybe even a bit more.
My only concern is, that you have to grind even more than in the first one. I personally don't have time for all of that.

In terms of content, I [i]feel[/i] like we are getting less than in the first one, but Red Hook already said, they want to support the game post launch with updates and some new content (some free, some paid). I am fine with that and still hoping for a return of my beloved Shieldbreaker.
But if the game really is worth 40 bucks ... thats for you to decide. I'd have waited for a sale, if there wasn't the reduced price for owners of the first game.

Sorry for errors, I am not a native. Thank's for coming to my ted talk.",1
138091998,1940340,"Get rid of boring town building and constantly non-available heroes, add even more complexity to encounter mechanics (as if torch was not enough there is now also a counter to increase enemy ambush chance) and generally condense Darkest Dungeon to what it made Darkest Dungeon: the battles. One battle after another, broken only by quick visits to inns that are basically the resting system from DD1 but with extras.

If you liked the battles best in DD1, you will love this installment. 
If you liked the maze maps or town flair best, maybe not so much.

138349708,669330,"This game is fresh and fun, and already high quality despite being early access.
- Positioning units feels more important than other games of this type.
- No RNG units. You choose what to unlock and buy.
- Units level up with experience, not merging.
- Units each have starting upgrades with a nice variety of synergies. More upgrades can be unlocked.
- The units all have counters, and feel generally well balanced.
- Choosing a perk after each round adds even more variety.

This game really satisfies the tactics and strategy itch",1

Maybe slightly less damage when losing so games can go into late game more often cause shit gets absolutely wild beyond round 9.

2v2 is pretty fun too, could use a 'faceoff' mode after one team member loses or something and to speed up the time between the two victors getting to combat again. Just feels like a lot of down time when the 2v2 transitions to 1v1.

Overall, excellent and can't wait to see how it continues to develop. I play a lot of Direct Strike on SC2 and this game just scratches that itch so well.",1

138127659,1494420,"I've dreamt of a game like this ever since I got into RTS games, a RTS/FPS was ALWAYS so cool, though this isn't the first game to do it (I believe the honor goes to Executive Assault) and I am in no way comparing the two since that game is so much more complex, in this games current stage it has a LOT of work that needs to be done, it really shows that it's a beta, with lack of features but it definitely has a lot of potential.

I have four main complaints though, so Imma just jump straight into them so you know what to look out for, for one I hope this is added soon, is a attack move option, I only played the Humans and the game has it where they shoot while moving so it's not that big of a issue, but for the aliens however, they seem to be a lot more melee focused, a lot of the time they tend to just run to certain points and completely ignore my units. So if that was just the Ai alone, it concerns me what frustrations a actual player would have when playing as the commander (RTS mode) of the Alien faction.

My second issue is Ui, the game is very bare bones on that, the game has it where you either jump into a match, make a multiplayer server or single player. There's 3 game modes but that's basically it. Add a options menu to the mix, and that pretty much sums up the entire main menu as of right now. At one point I was in the main menu options to start another game but I wanted to go back to see the other game modes, and instead of there being a back button, I had to go to the pause menu and ""quit"" the game which took me back to the main menu. Sounds weird and it honestly was. Oh as of right now, there's no way to configure your controls at least to my knowledge. (Except for mouse sensitivity.) Though when you're in game there is a handy menu in the pause menu that shows you the basic controls scheme, so you're not completely left in the dark.

Third problem I have, Is the Ai, now I know the game has a lot more other things to work out so I will be brief on this, I'd much rather have a playable game then just worry about the Ai, but since me and some friends much rather play against computer opponents this is something I'd like to bring up. So as of right now, the PvE side of things is EXTREMELY empty, there was no difficulties so what you get is what you get. I only played one game on single player and the Ai only sent one, two and at one point sent just 5 units to either scout the map or attack me. There was one point they sent I assumed was a uber unit and it came crashing down on my base, but unfortunately it kind of broke half way to trying to destroy one of my buildings, so it wasn't really as worrying as I thought it'd be. And after I killed it, a few minutes later the Ai began the same process of sending one or two units to scout or attack, before giving up entirely because I think it ran out of resources to kill me. After that I just kind of explored the rest of the map looked into some extra units and destroyed the Ai. Like I said this wasn't a super super big issue, as long as the game is balanced and the devs can improve the game itself, then I won't complain (yet) too much about this.

Fourth is map size, now I love MASSIVE maps but I love it more when my units don't take two years to get places. Especially infantry, you have no way to transport units as far as I know. I know players can ride vehicles which is good but if you're just one lone dude in the middle of nowhere, you're kind of hopeless to get anywhere on time. So I really hope there can be some way they can add vehicles that can transport your army's from point A to B, I have to imagine they already got this in the books. So just like with the Ai thing, I won't make a big fuss about this.

And with all that said, I know this game is still early access and I'm gonna recommend it because for being $20 this game isn't bad, I mainly played the RTS mode after I wrote this and the base building is awesome, the progression is fun, and the units feel and look good at what they do. And it's got some incredible potential for being a good RTS and FPS game with what could come next, so I am definitely looking forward to the future of this game as long as it stays on a good path that is... So I will give this a thumbs up for now. 

All I hope for.. Is it doesn't turn into YLands and go into development limbo.",1
138128121,1494420,"Pros:
- Engaging blend of RTS/FPS gameplay.
- Serving as a commander can provide an enjoyable experience, despite the occasional bugs due to early access.
- Each faction boasts unique strengths and weaknesses, enhancing strategic depth.
- The developer actively attends to community feedback on Discord.
- Battles between factions are epic and thrilling.
- The game holds great potential; patience and time will see it improve.
Cons:
- As an early access title, it has its share of bugs, optimization issues, and missing features.

Comments: I don't usually invest a lot of time in a game unless it's truly captivating. The first weekend I played this game, I found myself immersed for approximately 25 hours. Being new to the RTS/FPS genre, I found the game unexpectedly addictive. So, what makes it so enjoyable?

It's the thrill of defending your base against enemy infantry with your team, ensuring you continue to gather the necessary resources. It's the exhilaration of driving a tank through a bullet-riddled sky lit up by gunfire at night. It's the rush of pulling a 'Leroy Jenkins', charging into the enemy base to wreak as much havoc as possible. It's the sense of community forged with other players who also love the game. All these elements and more make every match an exciting experience.

The game is still in its early stages and does require a significant number of fixes, but don't let this deter you. If the 'early access' tag makes you hesitant about purchasing, I recommend adding this game to your wish-list and waiting a while before you buy it. Alternatively, you could just dive right in and join the community on Discord; you won't regret it.",1
138128294,1494420,"Great game to play with friends, just wish they could add walls for your base with more defensive systems, also allow you to place your HQ on another location before the match start, many other players gets the advantage of harvesting silica faster becaus eof their placement",1

138097921,1651490,"[h1] Tiny Life: Early Access Review [/h1]

Tiny life is a game where you can basically do anything you want to, it has aspects from the Sims and is a very good alternative to the Sims. In tiny life they have social/relationship aspects, children, job aspects, etc. Everything that you would see in the Sims. 

For an early access title I'm impressed with the amount of content and engaging stuff to do, so far I have put 3 hours at the time of typing this review and I'm enjoying it and I have not come across any bugs. I will list all my pro's and con's about the game and my feedback I have for the developer of the game.

[h1] Pro's: [/h1]

● Has similar aspects to the Sims 
● Engaging and enjoyable gameplay
● Has diverse options for your character
● There is barely any bugs
● Steamworkshop mod support

[h1] Con's: [/h1]

●  Tiny Life has repetitive music 
●  Constant mood swings from your character which gets annoying over time
●  Not many furniture options

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Tiny Life mixes Sims 1 gameplay and Stardew's valley art style and the developers did an amazing job. Tiny life is in early access and more content will be added over time to the game. This is a fun sim-like alternative if you looking for a game similar to the sims. And I'm looking forward to what to future has in store for this game.",1

138279291,2369390,"Classic Ubisoft at it again, taking a working format in the shape of FC3, 4 and 5 then making it worse.

The game runs worse than the previous titles with worse graphics (normalized to sameish performance)
It also has a great bug which limits fps to around 15 and the only way to fix it is to shut down the game and open it again so you get about 15 minutes to about 2 hours of game time before having to turn it off and on again. This wouldn't be as bad if the game saved more frequently or allowed you to save manually, but that doesn't happen and on every restart you lose about 5 mins or more of progress depending on when the game last saved.

Ubisoft also somehow managed to fuck up the driving physics of the game, the vehicles now struggle a lot more getting over small bumps and tiny obstacles and the tanks can't even cross small ditches or turn on the spot like they should. The helicopters also feel worse to fly than in previous titles.

The AI seems quite a lot dumber than previously. In a mission where I had to meet up with an NPC, it got stuck running against a fence and I had to down it about 6 times and try to push it away before it managed to run 50 meters to where it was supposed to go and meet up. What should have taken the small time of getting to the spot took about 30 mins of trying to unstuck an NPC.",0

From what I saw on streams and have now felt myself compared to Day 1, the last two patches have turned it into a more enjoyable experience. While it's playable now, there are still annoying bugs being worked on so keep that in mind. As more features get added and things get refined, it should be one of the best AFL games ever when it's up to scratch. If you're on the fence, just wait a couple more weeks.

(Okay Far Cry 6 isn't that bad, but as someone who hasn't played Far Cry since Far Cry 3, this game is a massive disappointment compared to a game that released 11 years ago).

Edit: never mind this game is absolutely terrible.  I hijacked a tank and drove it back to a friendly base which apparently allows me to summon a tank to use in open world from any friendly base.  I then proceeded to do just that, and then killed enough enemies while driving to a mission to trigger special forces to hunt me down.  The special forces then proceeded to shoot at me with a helicopter (which their machine guns did no damage against the tank) and charge at me with troops that rather would use their AK-47 instead of their RPG (not that they were even really able to hit me with the RPG even when they did decide to use it).  My character also so happened to be wearing an armour piece that automatically repairs vehicles if I'm inside said vehicle, so even when I did get hit by the occasional RPG, my tank was back at full health within seconds.

I wasn't a huge fan of the first game's insane playthrough length or how you were better off firing someone for having bad quirks than learning to work around them.

- The game's metaprogression makes it clear that your personal skill matters very little. You, and everyone else, will just bash their heads against the grind wall until you've done it enough to brute force victory. Yawn.  

- The fact that you're still rewarded if you get TPK'ed mid-run is pathetic. You don't even need to think ""hey maybe I should stop here instead of pushing my luck"", you have every reason to just blindly push on until you die.

The animation and sound is great, and I love the vintage Mac feel! Great for players of all ages.

Glypha is an arcade style game that was originally released (as I understand it) on the classic monochrome Macintosh back in the mid 1980s. The goal is simple, you have to hit the enemy while your lance is higher than theirs. This is tricky because the birds never fly in a straight line, they are always either falling or rising, so it's easy to mess up and hit an enemy when their lance is higher by accident, which kills the player. When you kill an enemy, they drop an egg that gives you extra points if you can claim it before it disappears. There are platforms to land on, but the floor itself is deadly.

138122585,1622800,"This game is awesome. Imagine being able to create your own Zelda-like dungeons with a proper UI. It feels like a perfect blend between something like Super Mario Maker and an action RPG.
First of all, the art style is fun. The bright colors and cartoony animations have a lot of life to them. The enemies and our main character all are drawn in a signature art style for this game. While sometimes I think the animations could use more frames to improve their smoothness, notably Fink's spin attack, overall, the looks are very polished.
Secondly, the dungeon designer itself is quite intuitive to use. If you have a mouse and keyboard, you can be quite dangerous with the editor. It's very easy to click and drag to draw enormous rooms full of tiles. That said, there are a few bugs here and there, but it seems like the team is actively fixing those as I write this.
Finally, there is proper online support for sharing dungeons, unlike earlier betas of this game. I can easily go and find new dungeons to play by entering the Dungeon Eggspedia area and browsing. While it doesn't have a ton of filters or other ways to sift through the loads of levels, there is potential for that kind of functionality to be added.
I think what this has going for it the most is potential. There are a few dungeon themes, monsters, and other features yet to be added. Sadly, though this game is a full release, it does still feel a bit alpha at times due to the bugs and somewhat limited dungeon-building variety. If you're OK with that, you will love everything else about it.",1

138088830,1566200,"Just what I wanted from the game: I installed it, finished the simplest possible basic tutorial and I was off to play.

Hockey games are simple, quick and fun. Having played NHL 94 (back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth) I was afraid that the game would become too easy but for the most part it hasn't. I think that the main reason is all the ""cheats"" at your disposal balancing the superior stats of your opponents. So far, I had great fun with this.

The goalie is not controlable and doesn't have the character nor a chance to be upgraded. For the most part I'm OK with this, especially while the game is Early Access. Hockey goalie is potentially  the most important position on the team and playing as a goalie, if it ever becomes included as an option, should be carefully customized and not just copy pasted from the skater mechanics. 
Once the main game is finished and out of EA, if the devs choose to attempt a special Goalie Expansion DLC, then I would probably buy it. Right now, however, I am glad that they are going for quality over quantity when it comes to game features.

138090741,1566200,"I remember playing SEGA NHL95 for thousands hours back when I was a kid. Also I played a lot of other NHL games. I am feeling so nostalgic and at the same time excited about Tape to Tape. However, I am worried that the game might not fulfill its tremendous potential in the end. Here are my thoughts ... 

Pros:
* Gameplay itself! Variety of ways how we can score is very good. I remember back in the day we learnt the most efficient ways of scoring and used to stick to them. At that time I wished we had proper rebound mechanics, one timers working better, one to one and so on. Here having played just for 6 hours or so I have seen so many different goals. Kudos for you devs for that. However, checking is not that fun but still decent. 
* I have discovered some references to the past, golden era of hockey. Like we did in 94! A.Gravy - A.Graves. U.Samuelsson, W. Gretzky, B.Shanahan and some other. The game is definitely being making with style and passion! Good job.

Cons and thoughts:
* It is still early acces, but sometimes It feels like Devs have cut corners. The most horrible example is when I discover that my benchwarmers play against their clones. Wiemer often play against Wiemer. It feels cheap and kills all immersion and atmosphere. Surely it is a fantasy world but hockey is all about players. 
* As we earn rubber, our main star gets stronger. Does it mean that at the start he is not balanced well to win the game? Is the only strategy to sucseed is to make overpowered main star? You should think twice about it. A lot of balancing is in order. 

Below thought are more about new game mode.

* Main game mode is of course fun. But we all wish we could participate in a proper tournament. It does not have to be as deep as NHL season of course. How about something like draft at first where we do not nesessary have our main star as CENTER, some luck is involved and we have to build our team around some weaker players? Benchwarmers should be unique as well (not as detailed but at least they should have unique name and basic stats and style). 
* More achievements I would personally like. This game I am going to play a lot since the most important aspect - gameplay is extremely fun. But I wanna get rewarded for winning with weaker teams, scoring goals with defenders, experimenting with diffferent playstyles, overcoming weak squad issues. 
* Injuries. Imagine if our main star is injured and our finals is ahead. We have to play with benchwarmers. Disaster, but it is Hockey. We want to face situations when we have to overcome issues. 
* Stats do not matter here. NHL is all about stats and records. Not sure hou this can be utilised, but these are just thoughts.

Revommendations:

* You are absolutely right about balancing the game. However I beg of you, do mot make the game too easy for a casual gamer. Or at least give us hardcore mode if in the future you decide to make the game easier. After all, roguelike is all about challenge. You can't win all the time.

138349507,1940340,"while I initially had a great time with it, this game just doesn't hold up to the OG.

way more complicated, with most of the game locked behind a currency you only get after losing runs. Artificial difficulty arises from the haphazardly organized UI, plus lack of optimization causes weird lag in certain situations (such as the entire overworld for Tangle due to the infinite rain).

they made a game that looks and sounds beautiful and an engine with a lot of different strategic variables to manipulate, but they shoot themselves in the foot by going overboard with complexity while putting almost no thought into a useful way of teaching the player in game about all the new mechanics.

Red Hook has successfully alienated both their returning customers by changing the entire format of the game and forcing you to have to lose runs in order to upgrade your heroes (vs DD1 which discouraged losing/retreat and rewarded winning) and their new customers by making it totally obtuse how you're supposed to actually improve as a player.

On the negative side, random encounters can ""surround"" you while traveling on the map, giving you no real options for escape; and some of the encounters can become very challenging, especially when you have to face them one after the other. Some option to make such encounters easier would be appreciated by some of the players.

And inventory management can become a nightmare in this game for a player like me. I hate micro-management. The sorting needs to be improved with more options to sort by, easy ways of discarding items need to be implemented, and also easy ways of moving whole stacks of specific items between containers need to be implemented (something like Ctrl+Clicking a stack to move the whole of it between containers or so). These are the standard options in other games. If the devs want to make inventory management even easier for players like myself who don't enjoy micro-management and inventory management generally, they can go further with creative ideas to semi-automate the process of prioritizing certain items over others or so and automatically discard low-priority items, where the priorities are customized by the player once in a set-it-up-once-and-automate-forever sort of way.",1

In an era of never ending early access games and AAA games broken at launch, this is a refreshing experience to have when you consider how small the DEV team is for this game and how they manage to deliver exactly what the trailer showed.

You can tell it's an ""Audience Tester"" to see if it's a universe worth expanding upon (and it absolutely is) because it's not the longest game to complete (around 16h for me but I'm slow and take my time) but everything it does it does extremely well. Beautifully crafted levels with its own art style, great characters that are really well voice acted (especially our protagonist Scarlet) and just a very natural and rewarding progression system to boot. I had an absolute blast playing this from start to finish and I'll definitely play this again on hard mode to get all achievements.

I hope that potentially there'll be added content or eventually a sequel that's longer but this game is worth its full price for sure. I'll keep an eye out on these DEVS for their future work and I hope they realise that this game is a resounding success all round.

Unfortunately, the online component is problematic and does not function properly. Attempting to block opponents is futile, as the key to winning is being the first to strike and continuously juggling your opponent until they are defeated. It is disappointing to see positive reviews for this game when it clearly requires more development.

138095538,1742020,"If I could, I'd give this game ""thumbs sideways"", because there's a lot of stuff that I like and stuff that I really hope gets addressed in future updates.

Pros:
- Amazing sprite work
- The various Mythology Gags and references 
- Having a Combo Breaker system for people like me that get constantly juggled
- Having actual singleplayer content
- Acknowledging Coco, Aloe, and even Rushia's existence unlike so many other Hololive fan projects 

Cons:
- No difficulty selection nor Continues for Arcade mode. 
- No quickplay option for Online matches
- Getting booted back to the main menu if your online opponent decides not to continue
- Despite having rollback netcode, I've experienced slowdown more than once in online matches (although this could just be my terrible internet)
- No visible way to keep track of online win/loss records (which seems important, since that's how you unlock one of the available color palettes)
- Noticed a bug where the character flip-flops between color palettes while viewing the move list
- Ollie being the only NPC with voice acting seems kinda weird. I know that this is something beyond the devs' control, but I'd still appreciate if they could somehow get audio recordings from the others.

138349099,1159690,"I would give it a MEH rating if I could, but I can't, so here it is:
The visuals and feel of the game is awesome, but the gameplay loop is just .. meh.
Usually in games like this you spend the first couple of hours painstakingly slow, setting up everything so you can be more efficient/automate things later. Well in this case, it's start painstakingly slow, then as you progress it get's even slower, because you need more material and more steps to make things, but the game gives you 0 improvement in terms of efficiency or automation. So you stuck with the super basic run up to every single resource and pick it up (spoiler: You get a grappling hook to extend your grab a little bit, but it doesn't help that much)
Combat is also pretty meh, even tho it's a bigger and bigger part of the game as you progress.
What I recommend is, get the game, play like an hour. If you love the core gameplay and think you can do that for 20 more, then keep the game, if not then use Steam's 2 hour refund policy to refund it, because it's not gonna be much better.

It's not exactly like the first game, but that's kinda what makes it great in its own way. 

Spoiler-free review.
<=Positives=>
Combat system is the GOAT - it's pretty easy to grasp while still being very deep and complex. 
The new 'token' system (dodge = 50% to evade attacks, greater dodge = 75% to evade attacks, block etc) might seem a little shallow compared to the first game, but it has a big moment-to-moment gameplay advantage - readability. You don't have to hover over mobs as much, e.g. to check their PROT and DODGE - instead, the icons are there to tell you that information from a glance. There are still things you need to check that way, such as resistances, of course, but overall, it helps speed up the 'easy' battles.

Rogue-lite format suits Darkest Dungeon surprisingly well.
You've probably seen quite a few comments saying rogue-lite makes Darkest Dungeon 2 not have the same sense of 'attachment' from the first game - wiping a party you've built over the course of a playthrough in the first game is quite 'an emotional' moment, to say the least. Let me tell you, without spoilers, it's very easy to get the same kind of feeling in this game too, as it's not a 'traditional' rogue-lite: your good runs more often than not last north of 3-4 hours, and when your team is doing well, you get quite the same 'chills' when approaching the act boss, as in the first game. Not to mention, there is a mechanic to make your 'run survivors' stronger permanently (well, until they die), so you totally can ""level up"" your group and attach to them (only to inevitably lose them to some bad rng/ skill issue)

Progression in on point.
Hero shrines in Darkest Dungeon 2 are Darkest Dungeon 1's comic backstories in a playable format. After entering one, you get a narration, or sometimes a 'puzzle' encounter, where you have to win a gimmicky combat scenario using the chosen hero. Those puzzle battles feel great, as you get to 'break the run routine', while also unlocking powerful hero abilities - that part is crucial, because, in my opinion it gives you the same sense of progression as building the Hamlet from the first game, except now it's not so much as indirect. It feels great to unlock a fun, party enabling skill - and, the best part is: you can use it right away! That is, if your party strategy allows it - and if it doesn't, it gives you the classic rogue-like 'go again' feeling.

Visual style elevated from the first game.
New vividly animated hero stances and actions give them a lot more personality, while also keeping the same 'feel' as the first game had: Bounty Hunter is confident and decisive, Leper is stoic and defiant, Helion loses her 'strength' and looks vulnerable when getting hit, Man at Arms is always on guard, etc. Unique Death Door stances make your party look as beaten as they really are, while also maintaining those established personalities. Hell, even the way your characters sit in the inn while resting sets the mood for the game! All those little things add a lot to the experience, and make the game feel less 'indie' compared to the first game - and I haven't even said anything about monsters or locations.

These were my 'major' positives - I could talk about tightened trinket balance, character build customisation and such, but those topics are pretty spoiler heavy, so ye nah. Now, for the negatives.

<=Negatives=>
Boss design is weak.
And I'm not talking about their visuals - most bosses don't feel very finely-tuned in this game. Act bosses range from being hilariously easy to borderline bullsh*t (if you know, you know). Minibosses suffer from the same issue: there are minibosses with barely any attacks, and there are ones with basically 4 actions per turn, spamming your party with debilitating debuffs.

Driving sections take some getting used to.
In many rogue-likes with 'Slay the Spire-esque map' you just click the destination and start the encounter. In Darkest Dungeon 2, you have to sit through what is effectively a loading screen ride, while navigating your coach to hit all of the rubble in the path in order to collect resources, as if you are playing freaking Subway Surfers. It really turned my off initially, but I've grown to accept it, which isn't the best. It doesn't help that there is basically nothing to look at while driving too, and that one of the areas has significant performance spikes (my GTX1080 can drop to 40 fps when driving a wagon across semi-2D forest, ridiculous) 

Uneven difficulty.
Hey, at least that's consistent with the first game. Yeah, some encounters are poorly balanced, and so are some of the 'elite enemies' (I would love to give an 'EXAMPLE', but that would be spoilers and I wouldn't wanna ""EXEMPLIFY"" such things. Seriously, fuck that guy). Honestly however, I wouldn't say that detracts from the experience, it's just something you have to be aware when going into the game, to avoid some frustrations (lol). I didn't use the Radiant torch (easy mode), nor the Stygian one and thought that overall the difficulty was fine, maybe even a little too easy, outside of a few exceptions.

<=Summary=>
Overall, it took me about 70 hours to beat the final boss (I got to it 40 hours in, but got caught up in altar unlocks and stalling). I went into the game with no expectations, and honestly, after playing DD1 for something like 200 hours, I think I prefer this game, because of the pacing and more 'front-loaded' nature - I am a pretty big fan of rogue-likes however, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. 
Btw, [spoiler] Alchemist - Arsonist - Vanguard - Shapshooter [/spoiler] team comp is busted, lol.

Logicats isn't strictly a *game* per se, but is a training tool for programming disguised as one!  As someone who has very little to no experience with programming (I dabbled in some html like most people in the early 2000s) I thought this was incredibly clever and helpful!

The music is simple and pleasant, the graphics are simple as well but clean and cute with the user representation of a cute kitty face and the end ""goal"" of each stage a ball of yarn.  There's nothing here that is mind blowing as you would expect, but it's nice enough to look at and is very clean and easy to read on the screen.

I thought it was so interesting how easily I was pulled into this as well - I'm not trying to learn programming.  I wanted to test this because I love little indie games and tools like this and I was curious.  Despite having no real interest in learning, I found myself going through all 100 stages of this in one sitting (took me roughly an hour to do).  I'll admit, I got tripped up in several places, but this game did a fantastic job of showing you through actions how to read the language.

I can see this as being immensely useful to kids and early learners of programming to pick up and read these prompts and language very quickly.  Sure I played through it once in an hour, but to really learn this and drive it home, I could see doing this several times a week as being a great way to learn.

All in all I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to learn or help teach programming! 

TLDR - Logicats is a fantastic learning tool for beginning programming language disguised as a clever ""reach the goal"" mini game.

138129817,1159690,"By no means am I a professional reviewer or anything like that. Going into this game I did see all the negative reviews and all that. Some of which I saw a legit issues with the game itself like not having an option to disable or lower the Narrator's voice which some people don't like. As well as the head bobbing and the very linear research lines the game currently has. Below are my opinion on these subjects:

For myself I don't mind the voice and I find the lines as a way for the Devs to poke fun at themselves as well other Devs that have similar style games. True I only have the 8 hours in the game at the moment, but to me I went into the game with low expectations for the narrator and so I am pleasantly surprised with it.

As for the head bobbing, I honestly don't know what people are talking about because I personally don't have any issues with it or notice anything that might be called a head bob and so cannot go deeper into this issue. I know this might be the biggest issue for others and as of the first hot fix that is already out, The Devs have expressed that they will do what they can to fix this issue as soon as they can.

Finally for the research lines, yes it can be annoying for it to be too strictly linear like it currently is. I do find it annoying that you have to research the gardens early on an so far I've built the one but I am unable to use it at all because I have none of the ""resources"" needed to use it. I can see this being a lot better and have high hopes that the Devs will improve this aspects of the game, but by no means do I see this as an issue to prevent people's enjoyment of the game. One of the smaller improvements I think that can be done is by selecting the research to be able to hover over the resource icons to know what is needed. As an example one of the resent researches I've complete required Resin and I didn't know what the resource was until later once I realized it was something craft-able in the Lab. But with more familiarity with the game, I'm sure this will become a non-issue for me, but might still be an issue for those new to the game.

Now onto other things I've noticed in the game:

1) The numerous different animations for the same actions like reloading your pistol. As far as I can recall at this point I've seen at least 6 different animations for reloading the gun, some of which are very strange to see but made me laugh and enjoy these little things in the game.

2) I have no clue what food does for you in the game. There is a hunger bar that goes down, and there seems to be no penalty to having it empty, because I've spent sever hours with it empty before dying to a fight or the flying ""Bruce"" of this game.

3) I've died a few times in the game by this point, and getting items back is mostly simple but due to one reason or another, I've lost my grappling gun once, my lowest level backpack, and a few other random things as well due to one reason or another. I'm not sure if its due to things glitching into the ground (when at a station) when doing a gun fight or what, but I'm always a fan of some sort of ""death"" bag or chest that holds all your items until you pick them all back up... even if its your own body.

4) This is more of an issue for me and the easy fix is to change the key bindings, but I've accidentally dismantled chest, stands, and other things that I've built when I meant to move them while in that mode, default N to enter the mode and G to move with F to dismantle. As we all know F and G are keys right next to each other. I would like for the defaults for these to be separated better and yes as I've said I could change the keybindings for these actions, but I wanted to let you all know so that you can prevent this from happening. And why this is an issue is because you don't get all your resources back when dismantling things. I do not mind not getting everything back because it makes you think if you need the items or not. Of which item storage is the main thing you'll probably need to make.

5) I don't know if this is a good thing or not, but you do get unlimited ammo for your pistol. As for any other gun (the grappling hook is a tool not a weapon) you have limited ammo. So I tend to not care about wasting ammo with pistol as I attempt to shoot different things in the game. Yes I know having limited ammo for weapons tends to only matter in the early game so it is nice to have to not worry about ammo for one of your guns in the early game and when you get a different gun it does have higher DPS and so it is nice to use those in some of the fights, but I find that I tend to just use the pistol because I don't need to worry about a limited ammo count.

Overall if you enjoyed Raft I'd think you'd enjoy thing game. Even just the little I've played in solo play I have enjoyed this game. I do see that it would both be easier and harder in multiplayer, like needing to build gear for 2+ vs just for you as well as having 2+ people it would be easier to gather resources and hold them because you'll have the more than 1 player's inventory to hold stuff vs just the 1 and whatever storage chests you are able to make in the early game. Just know what your expectations are for the game going into the game. Know that this game is still in its early access (and less than 2 days released on steam) and could use a lot more polishing to make it into an ever better game, but so far it has been a really good game IMO.

I am doing this review because I think the Devs are great and seem to take their players honest opinions and feedback into account as they try to improve their game. If you think you will enjoy the game, I suggest you do get the game, enjoy it and let the Devs know how they can improve yourself. When I know more about it, I might come back and do an update to this as well as things change and improve.",1

138119088,1582600,"Cute game! So far looks like it'll be a cute story. There's a decent amount to do in the demo. Controls are straightforward, sound is good, visuals are good. Would be nice to have some kind of mini-game for the tea-brewing and cooking, because if you're cooking a lot at once it can take a while to wait for it to finish. It would also be nice to have some kind of indicator that the food/tea is finished, and a warning that exiting the cooking screen will halt the cooking and you have to start over.
Otherwise I love that there isn't a penalty for not getting to bed on time, that's one of my big gripes about a lot of farming simulator games: not enough time in the day to do everything you want to do or go everywhere you want to explore. Sometimes I just want to walk around and enjoy the art, you know? Can't do that in Stardew or most other farming sims.

So far, I've only hired a few enemies, but I'm excited to see what other types of enemies are available and how they can help me progress through the game.

Your work as an engineer? You like Puzzles or Mahjong? Than this game could be to your liking too.
It is from the Dev Awaken Realms who made ""No Place like home"" or ""Fresh start"" so of course I gave it a try.
There is a free Demo so you can test it out.^^
There is a Turtorial, Standard game and a creative Mode.
What can I say I played 1 hour and only missed 4 lets say ""rezepts"". Sad look. But next time for sure.^^
It makes fun but you should not rush take your time and you could watch a ""Youtube Video from 
Real Civil Engineer"" this really helped me to make a decision.
I personally find the graphic here better than from Dorf Romantic but both have their own charm and thats okay.^^

Thx for this cute game, a fan.
PS: I just saw it was even 12 hours... ouch. You won´t tell my mum right^^?

Hi allerseits,

Ihr seid vom Beruf Ingenieur? Ihr mögt Puzzel oder Mahjong? Dann könnte euch dieses Spiel ebenfalls gefallen. Ich finde die Grafik ist besser als bei ""Dorf Romantik"" allerdings haben beide Spiele ihren eigenen Charm also ist es Geschmacksache.
Da dieses Spiel aus den Händen der Entwicklern Awaken Realms Teams entstammt. Wie ""No Place like Home"" oder ""Fresh start"" musste ich es kaufen.
Es gibt aber auch eine kostenlose Demo also schaut dort rein.^^
Oder guckt euch das Youtube Video von Real Civil Engineer an, das hat mir bei meiner Entscheidung geholfen.
Es gibt im Spiel ein Turtorial, Standard Mode und Kreativen Mod.
Ich habe 1 Stunde gespielt und mir haben nur 4 sagen wir ""Rezepte"" gefehlt, nächstes Mal schaff ich es aber!
Ihr seht also die Zeit vergeht schnell und ihr solltet euch auch Zeit lassen.^^

Vielen Dank für das schöne Spiel, Grüße ein Fan

138372734,1494420,"In the past decade, I don't think there's a game that's made me lose track of time quite like this. 

The Boys and Girl all love this game, and I do too. The game is incredibly cinematic and plays really well for early access. 

The Pathing needs work, and not having basic commands for your units is a pain, but the game itself is so fun I don't really find myself being bothered by it! 

Looking forward to future updates!",1
138372949,1494420,"Pros:
Visuals:
The visuals in the game are truly awe-inspiring and successfully capture the essence of the Dune aesthetic. During the dry desert daytime, the visuals effectively convey the scorching heat through details like heat distortion emanating from the sand and expansive, desolate landscapes that evoke a sense of hopelessness. In contrast, the cold and foreboding night atmosphere is skillfully portrayed, with the Night Vision gadget adding a new layer of fear and transforming how players approach encounters in the first-person shooter (FPS) mode. Particularly noteworthy are the Anchrid-like Aliens, whose gameplay is enhanced in the darkness of night, intensifying the overall experience.
Concept:
The influence of Command and Conquer, StarCraft, Halo, Dune, and Starship Troopers is evident in a highly favorable manner, creating an ideal fusion of real-time strategy (RTS) and the immersive ground-level experience of a realistic Dune experience. I would say there was not a single moment I was not immersed in the world design and the music for the game ABSOLUTELY sells me into the immersion more. Very well made for coming out early-access
The 2 factions (Humans) and Aliens (CRAAAAAABBBBSSS), namely Sol and Alien, have been fully developed and fleshed out. The Sol faction impresses with its authentic and believable units and weaponry for a Sci-Fi world-building. The attention to detail is evident in the design of individual vehicles, diverse troopers, and their respective weapons. On the other hand, the Aliens are truly horrifying and possess a formidable presence when their various components synergize, especially during the transition from day to night, creating an ominous atmosphere and allowing for one of the gadgets, Night Vision, to truly sell its mark. It is worth noting that the Centari and Sol are identical making it innocuous to assume that there will be a future update separating the 2 factions in some way.
World-Building:
The game's introduction made a stylistically excellent choice by utilizing transitioning an artistic interpretation to create amazing images and accompanied narration that sells what their story truly is. This combination effectively provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the game's universe and the overarching conflict. The execution of the introduction deserves high praise.
Gameplay and Functionality for Early Access:
Despite being in early access, the game demonstrates a surprising level of functionality. The RTS/FPS mode stands out as the most polished aspect, while the prospector (single/group FPS PVE) mode and the Arena FPS shooter mode are still in development. Considering that the game is primarily developed by a single person, with support from BIS Incubator, the current state of the game is highly enjoyable. It's important to acknowledge that there are existing issues, errors, and areas for improvement. However, the game's potential for delivering an enjoyable experience is unmistakable, and it's exciting to anticipate its continued development and growth.
CRAAAAAAABBS:
CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBSSSSSSSS:
Cons:
Human Harvester Pathfinding:
The pathfinding issues consistently hinder the progress of human harvesters, and units in general frequently experience difficulties due to poor pathfinding algorithms. I kid you not, the number of times I began LOSING bc one of my harvesters could do a simple 180 turn or bc they got STUCK INFRONT OR ONTOP of the harvesting depot forcing other harvesters to have to slowly make their way over to the other depots and preventing all the resources from being collected from ones that are stuck.
AI Encounters with Burrowing: 
The balance within the Alien faction is a complete catastrophe. Crabs, their basic units, possess the ability to burrow and become impervious to damage, while there seems to be no way to command AI units to easily cease attacking an underground crab at times. This can lead to a dragged-out combative encounter that can just be rectified with alternative commands.
Potentially Severe Lag:
The performance is severely affected by lag when dealing with a larger number of units, and the prevailing strategy for the Alien Faction is to excessively deploy shrimp units for resource gathering, resulting in even more noticeable lag.
Human Soft–lock Wins:
The Human faction can be rendered immobilized if their Refineries are destroyed, leaving them with no means of recovery.
Furthermore, destroying their HQ also leads to a situation of no recovery as it prevents them from constructing anything at all, leading to multiple avenues for games to become unwinnable.
Lacking Features of an RTS:
The RTS aspect of the game lacks essential (My Opinion) features. Although there appears to be a method for creating groups for the units, the absence of keybindings necessitates manually clicking on buildings to access build menus, navigating submenus, and an inability to directly select a specific building or unit.
No-Concede:
The game lacks a concede option, which means that when faced with an inevitable loss, players must endure a protracted and tedious process of having their buildings destroyed before the game concludes.
Swapping Teams Exploitive Wins:
There are no restrictions on team stacking, resulting in scenarios where one team dominates the entire server with a significant advantage over the opposing team, comprising no players.
Trolls/Griefers:
Trolls/Greifers can’t be controlled or expelled from lobbies, and the absence of measures to disable friendly fire is puzzling, considering the developer's capabilities.
QoL for Keymapping:
You literally cannot change the key binds for anything. There isn’t a way to toggle sprint or untoggle aiming despite those being the most prominent playstyles in most FPSs. Because of this, you're forced to use a mapping control scheme that (at least for me) feels very offputting and detrimental to gameplay. It’s very prevalent when you play in the FPS portion of the game and the maps are extremely large and oversized (Good thing) as this forces you to hold down the Shift button for an excessive amount of time (I spent over 10 minutes) to get to one side of the map. Easy fix, I know, but frustrating none-the-less
Summary:
Overall, the review highlights the game's impressive visuals, immersive concept, engaging gameplay, and the potential for further development. However, it also acknowledges the existing issues, errors, and areas for improvement, particularly in pathfinding, balancing, lag, lack of features, and community management. I would 100% recommend this purchase as it incorporates a way to directly support this project that is worthwhile and is a gem in a world of monotony. Absolutely worth buying for not just the price but the future development this will bring.",1

If you wanna spec into Nature and Barbarian tomes, by end game youll be stuck with armies of Teir 3 unites while the roaming armies and NPC armies are filled with teir 6+ and you will not win those fights. This leads the ""builds"" to be so boring, once you do a Barbarian run, thats it. it wont change. 

Getting Items for your heroes sucks in this version too. In planetfall you could buy gear for your units and heroes. in this one you can only get Hero items via clear camps, and it's 100% RNG. the AI doesn't seem to have this issue as late game their heroes will be fully decked out with gear while your main hero is the only with full slots. You can't even change gear/items on your units any more like in planetfall.

138352995,1669000,"[h1]Summary[/h1] 
Age of Wonders 4 is a beautiful and intelligent game for 4X beginners, casual gamers and those who decide to get acquainted with the series. However, at the moment (May 2023), the game lacks content and mid- to end-game mechanics, making it a hard pass for hardcore strategists and fans of the AoW series.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ For new players the game provides a gentle introduction into 4X basics and tactical battles.
+ The game features pretty neat graphics and UI (for a Paradox game).
+ It provides a high level of visual customization for your faction.
+ The role-playing aspect is nice and allows you to imagine yourself as the ruler of a fantasy people exploring and conquering a dangerous world.

[h1]Controversial moments[/h1]
* The Tomes of Magic system allows for constructing the technology tree during the game from a variety of thematic pieces with almost no limitations. So, you can make really bizarre builds like necromancer-druid-Chaos Lord-angelic being. However, you may never use the majority of combinations.
* The game is all about battles, and the economy is built around the military. Even ""peaceful"" paths to victory require a good army.
* The Pantheon system allows you to ascend your ruler as a godlike being after completing a map, which is nice but mainly unlocks cosmetics for further sessions.
* The routine of point-and-clicking your unit stacks at the global map is typical for all AoW games due to up to three armies each side taking part in a single battle, so you want to move a few armies as one steamroller horde through the entire map.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- The game, which is not cheap, is pre-divided into a bunch of DLCs, and the roadmap of add-ons was scheduled for a year in advance even before the release of the original game.
- The gameplay does not progress much through the game session, lacking significant midgame and endgame mechanics, such as espionage, World council, domestic politics, and so on.
- The storyline has been cut at the root.
- Diplomacy is rudimentary, and war is often the only viable answer.
- The AI is incredibly dumb and passive.
- Fantasy races are no more than cosmetics, with elves, goblins, rats, toads, etc. being just reskins for humans.
- The much hyped faction diversity is slyness, with only six factions (called ""cultures"") determining major faction mechanics, buildings, and core units. Besides that, you can choose two positive traits (basically, tweaking numerical parameters), a starting Tome, type of the leader (less magical or mora\e magical one), starting weapon for the leader, and that's it.
- Multiplayer requires idling while another player is fighting manually or making decisions. Hint for developers: look at Endless Legend or Humankind games.",0

138128526,758690,"For using windows 10 when it recommends Win 11 it still runs pretty good.  I am pleased with the graphics even with all the settings currently set to medium.  Looking forward to playing more, as well as future updates.",1
138130091,758690,"First off, yes, you should give it a go. Game has many flaws and is clunky as hell, but like many other said, it is EA. 

For the good, it starts with a campaign that get into the mood for the game, awakens you survival instincts. It holds your hand a bit too much at the beginning maybe, but lets it go real quick and the sense of achievement when you manage to survive your first few days is great. The art style is great, they went for the realistic not too futuristic approach, and I am thankful for that. 

Now a lot of things need to be improved. Some of the textures need a bit of work, and the characters and animation need a lot of work, that's for sure. What I found disappointing is the lack of feedback from the world. Grinding, mining or picking up stuff does not feel right. A bit like Medieval Dynasty in its early phase.

Some settings are kinda weird, like UI sound and environment sound not being separated, and the same goes for music and cutscenes. Also, a bunch of QOL improvement are needed, mainly relating to camera and aiming at stuff.

Performance-wise, it sucks. I've got a 3060 12gb, 32gb of ram and a ryzen 2600x and framerate varies from  about 20fps to 60+, there is some freeze and stuttering, all that good stuff.  So yeah, work is needed on optimisation as well.

But all in all, it satisfies my expectations and has evolved in the right direction since the prologue.",1

Malt, Vanilla, Wappa are your hard hitters, and you have Socks and Jin come in clutch for some fights. Hack and Boron were my Soul Cannon/Managarm dumpster fodder.

138114786,1824960,"First, let me say that this is a great ""jump scare"" and psychological thriller. The developers have done a fantastic job of setting the ""mood"" through dynamic lighting and music to create a setting where you genuinely feel fear. I have a heart condition, so I know a thing or two about jumping and being scared or startled. This is certainly a thrill ride for the senses! 

I hope that someone from the development team has an opportunity to see this review. There are two areas that where I would happily pay for a DLC pack. 

#1. (Peaceful Exploration Mode) 

Ladies and Gents, this game has some of the most realistic graphics I have ever seen to date in a VR title. I would love an opportunity to explore this hotel in depth without the Zombies. (You can leave the rats lol) I really want the chance to go exploring in this place. It is HUGE and looks so visually appealing that I can't stress enough how much a peaceful exploration mode would be a slam dunk.  

#2.. Free Mode - Range 

The opportunity to go to the ""range"" and practice with the weaponry would be outstanding!! The interactive Pots, or some of the targets you can hit and knock down. I would really like to see this area examined a bit more. 


Anyway, thank you devs for a fun, visually pleasing, reminder to take my Metoprolol BEFORE I put on the helmet!",1
138371297,669330,big moist,1
138372811,1566200,"This game definitely needs more. However, considering it's currently in early access and it is already the best hockey game on Steam is hopefully telling about the future of this game. Please get some customization in here and experiment with different things on gameplay. I feel that the $17.99 price tag I paid for it on sale is 100% worth it. I figured that maybe we can wake EA up to get NHL over here onto PC, and if not them then this game should rise above it.",1

138247507,1742020,it's pretty good,1
138247201,2369390,"The first thing me, my cooperative-mode friend, & a viewer of my stream said at the same exact time was ""Man, these graphics suck!"".

The antagonist does not stir any emotions, the gameplay & character movement is way too fast paced, many parts of the story are flawed; such as the protagonist escaping a boat being riddled with holes; Castillo being allowed to get away with the crimes he does even with civilians & his son idling by, the difficulty of the game isn't there; with tanks being found five minutes after having left said riddled boat, & workbenches being absolutely everywhere & plentiful for weapon customizations, overall the game feels like a rinse & repeat; the trailers are not comparable to the game; as usual, they copied the same story from their previous titles; basically the same villain-&-influential-bystander-as-protagonist, same game mechanics made worse, same downgraded graphics rinse & repeat from their other titles, & so on. And Lita, oh how they mention this character so much when I was around them for not even a minute.

If you are someone who just wants a game to enjoy & pass the time, & does not care about an immersive story or solid, paced gameplay, then this is for you. 
If you are someone who came for a story to embrace, a game that felt long & filled with content, & genuinely memorable characters, then this is not at all the game for you.

For a big game with tons of storage space taken up, it has felt nothing shorter of a basic game with forgettable everything.

There's so much more I could write, but for now I am leaving it as-is.",0
138274251,2246110,Sanity. What is it?,1
138251752,1230170,"Pretty much what you would expect from this dev and these types of games. Are you a fan of these ""work sim"" games like car mechanic sim, pc building sim, house flipper ect, and also have an interest in guns? Then youll probably like this. If your not a fan of those types of games and gameplay loop then, well, you probably wont. You already know what your getting really, and so far this demo delivers on what you expect. Nothing more, but nothing less either.",1
138352283,1277920,"Naahhh ...
Movement is too slow and awkward. Tile-based, am aware, but the movement overall is the killer for me.",0
138371586,1155330,"About halfway through and really enjoying the game although I have some issues with it.

I am an experienced real-time tactics player and find this game very easy even on hard mode. Maybe the difficulty will start really ramping up but if anything it is getting easier overtime. Grenades are a bit OP and even on hard you basically have all the utility items you could ever need and get given so many great guns doing trivial challenges that I never need to buy them. 

The aesthetic and gameplay loop is a heap of fun (aesthetic is Squid Game set in Judge Dredd style world) but the difficulty needs work.

My suggestions for improving the difficulty on hard would be:

- Either nerf grenades or give scum more health. Being able to kill 2 + every grenade makes too many fights way too easy.
- Give less rewards for everything. The game basically throws cash/fame/experience/utility items at you so I don't really feel like I am lacking resources at all. 
- Work on the AI a bit. Maps with the train mechanic are a bit silly because even when not actively trying to game it (as I don't play that way) at least half the enemies just die instantly from running on the traintracks and getting hit by trains. Also way too many enemies just squat and overwatch very far from combat and end up doing basically nothing until you pick them off while moving forward.
- Too much healing in between fights. I'm a big fan of the whole idea behind traps doing damage in the exploring part you have to take with you into fights. But you get so many healing stations it never really matters. 22hp is too much for hard imo and should be dropped a fair bit.
- Maybe make some of the more ""basic"" traps a bit harder. 

Overall I still recommend cause this is a really cool entry into the Real time tactics genre with amazing aesthetics and is still a lot of fun. But really needs to have the difficulty for hard looked at to actually add in a bit of challenge for players who are a bit more experienced at this type of game. I don't think the devs would need to change much just cut a lot of different reward amounts would go a long way to making it more tense and requiring more strategy.",1
138350176,1928090,"Very good for what it is: an extremely casual, easy, relaxed game with a nice story, art, and music. Fans of the Cook, Serve, Delicious series are probably not going to find what they're looking for here. It is a VERY different kind of game, and I think the devs may have made a marketing error calling it ""cook serve"" at all, since their longtime fans are likely to be confused and bored. But I don't think the game deserves a negative review. It's not bad for what it's trying to do.

As of this review (literally the day CSF launched into early access) there are still some rough edges. A few cutscenes are missing subtitles. Several mechanics are confusing and poorly explained (XP, levels, ""upgrading"" ingredients, the ""timer"" which never seems to move). And it's certainly not what I was expecting after many years of loving the CSD games. But the work done on the story, characters, music, and art have paid off. I imagine it would be a very fun game to watch someone play, and streamers might find some success playing it live.

The gameplay is extremely simplistic. Input is only four buttons, and there is nothing to memorize or look up: the prompts are displayed in a small area at the bottom of the screen and the player just has to follow along. There doesn't seem to be much of any penalty for making mistakes or going slowly. There also doesn't seem to be much of a reward for playing perfectly or quickly. It's a game I might load up when I'm feeling stressed or tired and just want something easy and relaxing to focus on for a while. It might also make a nice game for families with children to play.

My biggest critique right now would be that all the foods and levels feel the same. I don't feel like it matters which foods I choose at the start of each level. No matter what they are, I'm just going to be looking at the prompts and pressing the buttons in order. And I hope the game will get a more fleshed out tutorial.

If you're looking for a really casual, very beautiful game with a nice story, grab Cook Serve Forever. If you're looking for CSD4, this is not it.",1
138350580,1928090,"Cook Serve Forever takes a departure from the challenging and immersive gameplay of its predecessors, aiming for a more casual experience. While this approach may appeal to some players seeking a laid-back culinary diversion, it falls short of capturing the essence that made the previous games so captivating.

But I'm gonna take a minute to separate the team that actually made this game from the corporate money hungry giant that is Ubisoft. The first hour of the game I was blown away. The graphics are on another level. Like I can't even begin to go into how good this game looks and sounds. Just wow. The intro is your usual linear ""You have to escape"" objective with small tutorials along the way. But what captivated me was the chaos going on around the city. It had a chill to it I never experienced in any other FC game and felt incredibly immersed. The dialogue is effing gold. I was literally bursting with laughter throughout and it just keeps getting better. The story has been really good so far with the whole Father Son dynamic and does a good job at keeping you informed and interested. There are some new features that are really cool and some I probably haven't discovered yet but they add an edge that is new and refreshing. Some of those new features include the ability to ride horses and feed your crocodile fascists! There are weapon mods you can craft, gear pieces have perks, and you have a parachute you can deploy anytime just like in Just Cause! I honestly just bought this game so steam would get their cut and I could make fun of the fact I got a Ubisoft steam release for $15 lol.

138273661,1159690,"So far I would give this game a solid 6/10

It has so much potential to be greater, but it feels like the developers have friends that want to throw their ideas in that are ruining the overall vision!

The intro is humorous, doesn't fit.. scrap! Why do I say this, I'm 38.. Been there since Nintendo  Mario's days. Star Craft, Diablo, Terminal Velocity, Prince of Persia on MS dos. Sim City, Everything becomes bland my days. Then this game comes out and I'm like ""wow, okay something unique! finally!""

When you get to start to arrive at the first train station hub, the music! wow!... just hits home at an epic level of grandeur! The scale of a titan built obelisk! Compelling you with the music to not give up and to move forward! The chains that are like sky scrapers in length! the sky brimming with colors and the animations are epic! I felt like I was transported to another world! That! That is what I look for in a game at my age and what  I have seen and played over so many years.

Then you get into the hub, and the ""Nazi soldiers"" have the AI of a wet noodle and the brain of a potato. The hit box is horrendous and makes you wonder why this is a plot filler and check marker? 

After a while, you get to a point where you can get these ""SUPER CUTE"" cuddly creatures that you hire and have to feed on your train. Why? Who's idea was this? The modeling and color scheme go against everything that's in the game!

It's early access, but you can tell this is a small dev team that doesn't have direction. I give it a thumbs up because it gave me the impression of something unique and I want to support that! But, they are trying to mix 3 to 4 different themes or peoples ideas into one game and that's not going to work.

I won't give criticism without positive feed back.

(Ditch the engineer / guard intro finding the scientist shack in the woods!) Feels like an after thought. When you drive the train to the station and that epic music hits, why? That music is so profound! The art style is so direct! The vision was there! Why did you take other peoples advice and add things to detract from it?
Answer: You have swords and bows of colossal scale, the imagery is breath taking like it was divined from the gods! So, why not keep it that way? What if this is a test from the gods on humanity and ""you were chosen"" to forge the path? Greek gods of old waging war and are at a stale mate? They needed a human to see if they can push the boundaries of the subconscious mind ""train"" into the multiverse of reality? Could be that the protagonist is in a coma from WW2 or WW1 which ever you want to prefer and if they have the ""will"" to navigate the mind? AKA battlefield? represented in the wreckage's and the swords and bows and arrows in the background.

The companion system should be recollections of the past, former friends and companions during the World War. That the protagonist manifests into the subconscious reality. Not these weird cute cuddly creatures. 

This way the ""Nazi's can be kept in the game as a antagonist"" that the gods use to hinder your progress to see if you can over come your coma. Is the will to live stronger than giving up in the void of the subconscious mind? The fate of the heavens is determined by your actions and the gods are watching.

Bam! epic story! flows, not weird stuff being thrown in for no reason.. the cute cuddly creatures feel like a girl friend was like I want something CUTE!!! so you added it. The Nazi's .. why? You being some random person in the woods finding some shack? weird.. doesn't flow? Why have such epic art in the world if you have conflicting story arcs! Dial it in DEVS.

To the person that made the world art! I tap my hat to you good Sir/Ma'am! You have done a fantastic job! Who ever created the music leading to the train station hubs in the void! You have moved my heart! Thank you! But, everything else, poor.. poor decisions and is being wasted! It doesn't Flow! 

It's early access so please change direction and make an okay game to an EPIC game!.. no pun intended.",1

138274734,1159690,"Gee, this game gets some flak, despite the clear warning at the beginning that the game is not finished and that  the developers have yet to add more content, tweaks and bug fixes... don't rant until a finished product is available, if you are still unhappy by then.

For me, I like this game.  The 'grind' is a zen like experience which I found relaxing and I don't mind the research and smelting not reflecting real life, because it's a GAME. I wonder if the same moaners have ever played a game with magical characters and then moaned the next day because they couldn't cast 'Fireball +2 ' into a crowded bus stop across the road?

The graphics are good, it runs fine on my old laptop too, a core i5 GTX 1050. 

The story line is... up to you to discover. I like the voice-over humour  too.

This is a  floaty,  trippy  train ride of a game, with the aforementioned  'grind'  in the Void interspersed with off the train antics for you to get up to. 
Yes it needs a little improvement here and there, but it's in a perfectly playable  state and that's more than can be said for many early access games. The developers should be encouraged through early access times, not slated.",1

Room of Depression is a game that offers a unique experience for players who want to understand and empathize with the struggles of people with depression. The game revolves around the life of Moon, an ordinary office worker who suffers from depression. Players will be able to experience her daily life and how she reacts and deals with situations differently from others due to her illness.

[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]

The game's focus on the atmosphere and experience of depression is executed brilliantly, immersing players in a world that is different from the norm. The events that take place in Moon's life may seem ordinary, but they have a profound impact on her mental state. As players navigate through the game, they will be able to see firsthand how depression affects one's perspective and perception of the world.

The game's mission to explain depression is commendable, and it is achieved through the gameplay itself. Players are not simply told what depression is; they are shown how it feels. This approach makes the game both educational and engaging. Players will not only learn about depression but also gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of the struggles of people with depression.

Moreover, the game's commitment to donating part of its revenue to charity fundraising projects is a testament to the developer's desire to make a positive impact on the world. This move sets Room of Depression apart from other games in the market and shows that it is more than just a game.

One aspect of the game that could be improved is its replay value. Since the game focuses on Moon's life and experiences, players may not find much reason to play it again once they have completed it. However, this is a minor issue, as the game's primary goal is to provide players with an immersive and educational experience.

[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]
In conclusion, Room of Depression is a game that should be played by everyone, especially those who want to understand depression better. The game's immersive atmosphere and focus on experience make it a unique and engaging game that educates players while providing them with an empathetic view of depression. With its commitment to charitable causes, Room of Depression sets itself apart from other games and showcases the potential for games to have a positive impact on the world.

138255042,2001340,"Recommendation is absolutely contingent on your enjoyment of the first game, because this sequel is more of a chapter 2 than something you can just pick up and understand like a zelda or whatever.

But absolutely if you loved the first one, get this.

If you were on the fence with the first one... I actually don't know if the new gameplay is interesting enough to really grab you. But things move a lot faster, some enemies have new gimmicks, dialogue choices matter a bit more, and maybe most importantly, the central gimmick of the series is fixed - the new Soul Cannon will force itself to fire if you don't move fast, which also incentivizes using the Managarm.

Also since they don't have to introduce a bunch of kids this time around way more of the plot is focused on doing plot things with character arcs and so on.",1

I would never have predicted that another artist I follow would make a game of their own. This time randomly finding them through Twitter, I have been following hcnone for a while now as I liked their artwork and their OCs. So when I saw they were making a game, a visual novel one to be specific, and saw the cute artwork I was instantly looking forward to it. A surprise game release later and here I am writing a review after completing the game!

Considering all the characters have already been established through comics and zines hcnone made, I’m sure there are those that are wondering how it stands on its own. Well, I do think you can play this game and still understand everything even with little to no previous knowledge on the Endless Monday characters. You may not get the references or know the characters’ personalities going in, but I feel there is enough to go on just in this game. Heck, I didn’t even know these characters were a part of a zine, or there was some sort of a storyline outside of the occasional funny comic, until recently (I didn’t even know Skye quit her job until I played this game haha).

Anyway, Endless Monday: Dreams and Deadlines has us play as Penny in a situation that a lot of us has been in. It’s Saturday and Penny has a project that’s due on Monday. A project that she has made zero progress on. It’s not like Penny didn’t have more than enough time to do it, she had a couple months to do it, but she just didn’t have any inspiration other than drawing Tiger-chan. So what is this project? Penny, as part of the Creative Team, was tasked to create at least six illustrations with a pleasing aesthetic and motivating slogans for advertising campaigns for something called a ZINEBOT 6000. ZINEBOT 6000 is, as you can guess, a robot, but it looks kinda ugly and Penny has no idea what it even does as the project document is pretty vague on it. Honestly, I understand Penny having no inspiration, I don’t even know what I would make in this situation.

So here she is, after months of procrastinating and drawing Tiger-chan instead of working, she’s stuck at the office on a weekend late at night. Even worse, Miss Whiskey calls Penny while she’s out drinking to invite Penny and Miss Whiskey might have had the impression that Penny was almost finished. She didn’t want to disappoint Miss Whiskey and sadly her lies caught up to her. Since just sitting at her desk isn’t bringing in any inspiration, you’ll be exploring the office as Penny to hopefully get struck by inspiration. There are various parts of the office you can go to and you have the option to think, talk to someone if there’s someone in front of you, or do an action like guessing a password or snooping. You can also bring up Penny’s phone where you can check her “to do” list and call someone to talk to and maybe get some information out of them.

The story goes in directions that you might not suspect, but it all fits together without seeming out of place no matter how weird it may be. I think it helps that it is a humorous story and everything is treated like it’s possible within the universe. I don’t want to spoil anything, but it ranges from finding out how other characters are doing to dreaming about your succulent plant being a judgy buff dude. You also do get to interact with the other characters pretty often and it was a delight learning about the characters and some of their backstories or how they’re doing. I also really liked the writing style here. Each character’s personality and their current emotion easily shines through and even adds some social commentary without feeling overly obvious, preachy, or out of place; all while keeping everything comical and light.

There are a couple of endings you can get depending on what you do. A lot of them depend on how far you get (or don’t get) on the project before Monday, but some are based on certain choices you make while playing.

Aside from the minigames that are tied into the story, there is a minigame you can go and play in most scenarios. This minigame is called Lumbar Lass and it takes the form of a phone game. It’s pretty simple, you play as a young lass, which looks suspiciously like Hana, happily chopping down trees, running forward to the next tree to chop, and repeat endlessly…or until you’re too tired to continue playing. All the logs you gain are accumulated as your score and there is a leveling up system that ups your power when meeting certain level milestones. You also have a chance at getting a speed or power power-up (or both so you can go log wild) from trees and every so often you come across a shop manned by Skye. Although, considering the shop is a log cabin and the young lass may be Hana, you chop it down and grab all the air fryers to get a big 2x bonus to your log count. As you continue playing you do get more logs per tree from what I can assume is a passive leveling up perk.

It’s honestly pretty addicting, which definitely fits it being a phone game, and I had to set milestones (like stop after the power ups wears off or after getting X amount of lumbar) so I could tear myself away and continue through the game’s story. 

I don’t really have any big complaints against Endless Monday: Dreams and Deadlines. After finding out that the ability to skip text (and to quickly complete the current text box) was just an option toggle away, the only complaint I have is that I wished you could hide the textbox. Penny may possibly have taken up the favorite character spot, but Skye was there first and I just want to see her cute sprite without the textbox being in the way. Plus the other characters, but especially the Skye. Other than that, I can see some not liking the short runtime (about 2 hours for a first playthrough). Personally, I didn’t mind the runtime and I think the length fit the story well.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
To be honest, the reason I mainly picked this game up was because I follow hcnone and I really like their artwork. Plus, the preview showing part of a conversation with Skye made me laugh and it seemed it had the type of writing style I enjoy (as Skye was my favorite character). Well, I can safely say that I really enjoyed Endless Monday: Dreams and Deadlines. I loved the artwork (which is a given), the story is enjoyable and funny (even with limited knowledge on Endless Monday), the music is great, and I loved Penny as a main character and being able to interact with the other Endless Monday characters.

If you’re looking for a short, funny, and enjoyable visual novel look no further than Endless Monday: Dreams and Deadlines! It’s definitely worth picking up.

Now excuse me, I must get a high score in Lumbar Lass as I totally not procrastinate.

138106644,2262610,The first game I went out of my way to 100% because I wanted to experience everything the characters had to say and do.,1
138113857,2262610,A goofy and short game with a surprisingly poignant message about ongoing discussions in online spaces right now.,1
138129905,1940340,"Played it a bunch during early access and it was fun to see how the game evolved over time, and with full release I can confidently say that this game turned into one of my favorites.
Pros:
- Similar combat system to the first game but simplified and less RNG based
- Even though the runs are very long the pacing feels good
- Excellent soundtrack (due to the fact that each track takes around 8 minutes to loop it doesn't get boring which is good considering the turn based combat)
- Very good animations (when I played it for the first time I was amazed at how each move had a different preparation animation when selecting your moves)
- A lot of the changes to the combat system promote a more aggressive play style (no more OP stuns, and no more stalling to full heal after every fight)
- Excellent atmosphere and theme filled with many grotesque creatures
Cons:
- Pretty steep price (even with the Iron Crown bundle discount)
- Some hero paths feel uninspired (especially with the new Flagellant and Vestal paths which are a lot more interesting)
- So far no playable Crusader >:(
- Lack of instant driving might be a detriment to some people (but with upcoming mod support this will definitely something that modders will address)

The last 3 cons will most likely be addressed in the future, but I'd say that the game is rather expensive so if you're not confident in the fact that you'll play it a ton I'd wait for a bigger sale, but if you're sold on the idea then give it a go.

138129621,1940340,"I knew from the very start that DD2 was NOT going to be like DD1 - I distinctly remember the devs making this clear early, but I understand if people missed this. I avoided the EA and spoilers like the plague, so I could go into this game just like how I did the first one: blind.
With that said, I am over the moon at how much I love DD2 so far. It is a very different, yet strikingly familiar, game. The art is incredible. The atmosphere is brilliant. The gameplay is brutal and unforgiving. And I love every moment of it.

138095760,1179580,"[h1]I really don't understand how this game is getting Very Positive reviews? First things first, I'm not saying this game is bad, in fact, it's a really good game and developers did amazing job. I do reccommend it for you to play it but 25€ for an Early Access game that needs a lot of fixing, I cannot get over few things so I'll keep it short.[/h1]

I really like the RPG aspects of this game. Everything feels rewarding, collecting resources isn't forceful, it's something you do while exploring and solving quests. You can use resources in different ways, such as making food for HP and stamina, upgrading yourself in terms of unlocking new skills, making yourself more powerful and harder to kill etc. There are 4 different regions to explore so you have plenty of things to do and the graphics in this game feel incredible. Another thing I really like is the fighting system. It's simple, you can use different skills that require certain combos in order to work, you even have super powers that you unlock later in the game, you can use your slingshot to kill enemies from afar and use your Piggy in different ways to help you reach your goal. Also, Kaku can really look badass with all the equipment you can unlock while opening various chests and solving puzzles that you can put on him to make him look different. Some bosses are really hard to kill and some are not which is fine because it gets challenging over time and you do require some skills or cheating skills (only shotting them with slingshot) to win againts them.  

Putting all the good things aside, this game has very annoying bugs. First things first, I hope I'm not the only one that has this problem but while exploring and running around the world I'm consistently getting stuck on small rocks or on invisible walls which gets really frustrasting because I have to keep using SPACE to jump over them or go around them. Second thing is the fact that Kaku feels very slippery next to edges which makes him fall off very easily. Sometimes it happened that I cannot deal any damage to an enemy because he has that yellow invisible shield which makes him unhitable that disapears over time? Not sure if it's because he is using his attack and I have to dodge or something but would appreciate if some one could explain this. 

Also, fighting is very repetitive in this game, you will usually fight againts the same enemies in each region but each region also has different type of enemies. For example, there are always these pigs that rush towards you as an attack in every region but there is also Scorpion typical for earth region. I'm not sure what to think about this. Some attacks are better than the others because it doesn't feel very balanced. For example, slingshot can be really useless sometimes and deal almost no DMG to enemies, but on the other hand, while using your shield attack, it can be really powerful. 

The story feels dry, cutscenes aren't that good because they feel rushed and characters in the game always use the same sounds to communicate. There is no proper character developement in this game even though it's based on Kaku. There is also a lot of text to read. Another thing to mention is that you can't really play around with graphic settings (even the game tells you it's best to use just medium settings) since it can lead to FPS drops due to it not being best optimized and you can't really change the resolution by that I mean that the screen shrinks and it's not fullscreen.

To conclude, every other aspect of this game is good: abilities, progress, environmet, non-platforming simple puzzles, collecting resources, fighting bosses, but those micro things such us better Quality of Life options are desperatley needed in this game. Why does the game force me to click and hold all the options, even quitting the game, instead of just clicking on it? The bugs also need to get fixed because it gets frustating and the animations aren't the best, especially the jumping from another rock to the other. 

As much as I want to recommend this game, it's not possible and my score would be 5/10",0

138247374,1730250,"Do consider reading this review before buying the game. This game was made with no love.

I originally played the game after I watched both Blitz and Real Civil Engineer lose the game. After a long while of watching these 2 youtubers play different kinds of games, I decided to finally try one of the games they play and recommend. Its also right up my alley, city builder, strategy, urban planning, but lo and behold, I learned my lesson the hard way. Good thing its only 6 dollars and so its not really much, but boyy im never buying anything recommend by sponsored youtubers ever again.

I watched Blitz play and thought huh, it seems so easy how can it even be considered a strategy game and most importantly, how did Blitz end up losing? To be fair, Blitz isnt the best strategy game youtuber out there, but he also isnt really dumb. I wondered quite a bit, then I saw real civil engineer play the game and he did some real good optimization, and yet both of them lost at the 1 hour mark. 

So I thought, the game is probably not as easy as it seems, perhaps theres some hidden machinations that make it more exciting than it looks. Perhaps the difficulty increases, or perhaps there is more content, after all, what kind of sponsored youtuber shows you the entire game right out the bat. 

So I bought it, played it up to the one hour mark, up to the two hour mark, and finally I finished at 2 hours 30 mins. Yes I finished the entire game in 2 hours and 30 minutes. 

I realized at the one hour mark just why both youtubers lost at this point. It wasn't that the game got progressively harder, or that it required actualy strategy, they literally just lost it. They lost their shit, not the game, their shit! The game is so boring, even if you were buddha you'd lose your patience at the 1 hour mark. It was a grueling grind, literally you do the same thing for hours, and oh lord it is tedious. The game looks zen, but dont let it fool you. Theres nothing zen about having to zoom in and out, trying to differentiate from similar looking tiles, trying to look for the missions that are already so small since the map has gotten so big. It literally felt like a visual acuity test. 

And by the way, have I even mentioned the unoptimized game settings? I know my laptop isn't the best laptop for gaming in the world, but I could play minecraft and Dota 2 with no problems in this intel i5, with an nvidia geforce graphics card. But this game? It lags, it freezes, it bugs out, and the scrolling becomes progressively slower as you play and add more entities into the game.   

There is no strategy, no difficulty, and no zen in this game, just hours of mindless clicking. 

Good lord, I could say I enjoyed the first 30 mins, but after that, its just a painful grind. 

Yeah, absolutely, do not buy this game.

Guess it’s that “that’s x-com baby” tier rng at work. 

And I can’t emphasize this enough, this isn’t the first games style or mechanics at all, it’s a lot more enjoyable and respectful of my time and effort, and I don’t feel like I have to keep a wiki page open for every little thing I encounter.

I've only had some UX issues, like accidentally skipping the tutorial because I wanted to see if there were subtitles on video cutscenes (they aren't any) and the only way to play it through again was to delete the save game.

The amount of work it takes to accomplish things is a bit tedious though, you gotta mine and grind for hours to get up to a respectable level of development. I also would like more 'missions' in the story mode rather than just grind. Certain items you need are really hard to find like circuit boards, so I hope there will be a function to make those yourself. Plants are whiterring even though I hooked up a ton of solar panels and batteries, it just doesn't really tell you what you need to do different to make it work properly.

I was not bored for a moment throughout the game; all of the characters are interesting and leave me intrigued to see more.

138274245,2387660,"Do you like jumping? How about it not working when you press the button to jump?? If you answered yes to both these questions, you'll love this game! 

I want to write this to help the developer in hopefully making this game better. I wouldn't say this is a terrible game. I'd say this game is very uncomfortable. It's an awful feeling when a game has this shortcoming, because it's very hard to overcome. I'll explain specifics so it makes sense.

Before I say a bunch of negative things about this, there are a few redeeming qualities.

PROS

I really enjoy the visuals in the game. It's exactly how it looks in the trailer which I don't consider a bad thing. It has an great visual atmosphere that could be very versatile. 

The puzzle aspect of the game has a comfortable layout that was straightforward while making it something that you would solve in a series of lives, learning from each mistake. At first I thought the crystals/paths should be color coordinated, but that would take away from the immersion of the puzzles (Not that they're very difficult). 

The sound of the game wasn't bad. I normally play with music on when I'm playing so sounds aren't a big selling point unless I'm playing a game that requires sound, but I always check it out to see if it fits, and if the music is good. I'd say the visuals and soundtrack would be the major selling points.

Cons

You have platforms that fade after jumping on them. This is a classic trope in 2D gaming. The platforms, however, have no indication that this will happen, and there's platforms that look exactly the same that don't disappear. Designing something like it looking cracked or a different color would fit well with this. This wouldn't be such a big deal if your jump worked when you press it, but if you're not on solid ground (Platforms don't count as solid ground), your jump doesn't work if you're moving. This leads to you running straight into spike pits that are instant death because the basic essentials of movement in this game are flawed. 

When the color palate changes, it makes it so you can't see your health/stamina. I mean, I know I can count to 3, but this shouldn't happen. It also makes the game less detailed in general with the background blending even moreso with the foreground. This palate change seemed pointless as well, so it having negatives while not adding anything to the game was a bad decision in my opinion. I'm not discussing the ""outside"" vs what appears to be ""indoors"". I'm discussing the part that looks like it was made to play on an original Gameboy.

The control layout was weird. Using O and P instead of regular keys like space, z, x, shift made it even more uncomfortable than it needed to be. I used a controller and changed the layout with Steam button mapping, but I always try out controls on the keyboard to see if I am comfortable before switching to a controller because you always have more control with KB&M over a controller.

You unlock double jump very quickly. When you unlock double jump, you also get unlimited power to fight the boss, but that goes away and only reappears during boss fights. I really feel like the stamina should regenerate over it being 3 shots, and then it wouldn't feel so off switching from unlimited power and back to 3 shots. Also when you're at unlimited power and jump/shoot, you glitch back to the ground and your shots sometimes disappear. When you're fighting a boss that is attacking you, movement is vital, and losing attacks because you're dodging and attacking at the same time is disappointing. If this is such a big issue that it can't be corrected, I'd turn off shooting while jumping. It's already not possible to attack regularly while jumping, so it would be plausible.

Dying is annoying. I get that there should be some sort of fail sequence, but the levels are too bland to have to be replayed over and over. If jump was reliable, it wouldn't be so bad. IMO this is the biggest flaw and it effects multiple aspects of the game, hence why I keep bringing it up. There's so much unused space in the levels, just filled with jumping to platforms and over spikes. This brings me to thinking your life bar should be bigger AND spikes shouldn't be one shot kills. It's just so much dying and hoping jump works the next time.

Is there any point in the game over sections? I feel like they're just tedious rooms that you can waste your energy on. Maybe if a level makes you die to get a crystal from one, it would make more sense, but I couldn't get over the jump button being flawed to finish this to find out if that was a puzzle in this game.

The lack of diversity is something that is literally joked about in the game. Really? You shouldn't take pride in something you know is going to be a complaint. I played through 2 bosses and got over it before getting to the third. This was because I spent 10% of the time playing the game and 90% getting back to where I was because jump didn't work. During these levels, I saw a total of 3 enemies that weren't bosses. I went through multiple sections. It wasn't like there was 3 rooms, more like 20. 3 enemy types this entire time. One that stumbles toward you. One that plays a harp that does a ranged attack at you. Then the last is the worst. It's a turret, shooting ranged attacks at your direction or shooting in a straight line meant to be an obstacle... and they can't be attacked. So if they're the type that shoots in your direction and you have to make a jump when you're in their range, you're getting hit no matter what. One of the sections had this, and it made you jump twice off disappearing platforms while you're in it's range. It's at the end of the section as well, so you have to replay the entire section if you fall or got hit before because you're 100% getting hit twice by this no matter what.


I know this isn't a ""Early Access"" game, but it feels flawed to the point where it should be fixed. If jumping was fixed, I would consider finishing the game, because what I played besides the nosediving into spikes wasn't terrible. I hope there's a bit more variety in the bosses than just avoid and attack them while they're moving towards you in a pattern, but I'm unsure if that will be a thing seeing as there was only 3 enemy types in the first 3 levels of the game. I've made worse reviews for better games because I knew the game wouldn't get fixed. I hope that isn't the case for this one. If this gets worked on, I'll change my review accordingly",0
138274021,2381160,"Game's great. There's a lack of customization for the starting party, but I am very happy about the quality of the game.
If you have played Pathfinder 2e, even if it's just the Starter Box, I am sure this would be a fun little adventure for you.
If not, this is a rather decent alternative/""pre-gaming"" before you get into Starter Box - or perhaps another tryst in Otari?
Note that this *is* based on the TRPG, so RNG will absolutely ruin you, and not having basic knowledge of how Pathfinder 2e work may be disadvantageous. I unfortunately can't erase TTRPG knowledge from my mind, so this review is coming from the angle of a TTRPG veteran.

In term of difficulty, I haven't played hard mode yet, but...
The loot is *very* generous, and the availability of the night's rest in middle of the campaign allows for rooms for mistakes for the two casters in the party.
I haven't done the math, but I assume the encounters are rather balanced. There's a few jokes that earned a chuckle from me, such as mention of the fight being literally of trivial difficulty.
If you play the game carefully, with proper usage of flanking, demoralize, raising shield, and cantrips, this is very doable blind on normal mode - perhaps even easy.
(It would be nice if there are extra shields, btw; Having an extra shield for either the cleric or rogue would make for interesting strategic choices at times, even if they aren't able to use shield block reaction - that +2 circumstantial bonus to AC is great. Sorc's fine, she's got Shield ;) )

One thing I would like to see, albeit perhaps difficult to implement, would be a small segment playing with subsystems (https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1187) as well as some hazards. But that's for later!

I keep seeing, ""It's supposed to be more laid-back than the regular game story, so you can get the actual story of the character!""
1. Adding difficulty to a game does not remove the story line. If that were the case, souls games wouldn't have the reputation they do for their story and their difficulty.
2. While the intention was to make the game ""easier"", it really isn't. All of the buttons you push are arrow keys and the previous button is also an arrow key, prompting players to hit the left arrow for previous regardless of whether or not that was the actual previous button. This is bad game design.
3. You can't open the menu at any point in time in the game and just back out of where you are or force-quit the game all together.
4. If this game were really trying to remove the difficulty, they should just have had an easy mode. A mode just like this one, but that you had to opt-in to.

It's always great to see, for example, a fire call come in and then the firemen actually request an ambulance. Or an ambulance call where an EMS requests police secure the area. It's not needed at all in any way. Every call only requires one person. However, the game really shines when players request multiple services at a scene.

The game is not really for grown up man, like, if you like this puzzles game, its a nice game to play. But I feel the game is more for kids around 10-15 years to teach critical thinking. I think is still worth playing in a nice chill sunday.

You can view my gameplay & initial impressions here: https://youtu.be/IpYBnJEzxmc

For being completely free at the moment, I can recommend this game. It's got a nice-sized player base for being launch day and online VR only. Beware though: there are several squeakers. 

Content is very limited at the moment. It only has a Demolition mode where you can choose between players only or a mix of players & bots. There are six heroes, each with very different abilities. Team play is heavily incentivized where you probably want a nice mix of hero powers, including shield & heals. The TTK is pretty quick & I would describe the gunplay as arcade shooter.

Rounds are pretty quick and you do switch sides of playing either defending or attacking team. In between rounds you can purchase better weapons, limited use items, or armors to get a leg up in the next round. Special abilities for each hero are on cooldown, some pretty long cooldowns. The different abilities are pretty cool.

However, there isn't a huge variety of weapons. The maps, while having nice verticality, are pretty generic. This game definitely needs more content overall. Since it is free & in Early Access, I can give it an easy recommendation. 

Game is running on the Unreal Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting steady 90 fps. I did not experience any serious issues or bugs. There is full locomotion available, along with smooth or snap turning, plus several comfort options. You can play the game comfortably seated.

Beware though: devs do state they plan to add paid DLC and to add pay to play mechanics. So right now would be the time to play this game, before the monetizations happen.

I've been waiting so long for a good Starship Troopers game to come out - so obviously, ""I'm doing my part!"".
It has some performance and network issues, a bit weird class and weapon design/balancing - but the foundation of this game is rock solid. 
The current game modes get a bit stale after while, so I hope they add more in the future, like the planned ""Horde"" mode, or maybe something like a longer skirmish mode. 
The unlockables are a bit barebones atm. and are basically the same regardless of class - also after unlocking a new weapon, you will basically never use the starter Morita Mk 1 rifle again, which is a bit sad. At least add a bigger magazine or shotgun shells, to make the rifle a viable choice over the Morita Carbine.

But!
Nothing out there on the market right now, that comes close to the feeling of defending and subsequently evacuating with hundreds of Arachnids chasing you down. Great fun!

138498269,1559600,"The game is in a pretty decent state for an Early Release. Everything stated below is with the acknowledgement that the game is not complete. I will adjust over time.

This game is worth the purchase and time, in my opinion. Below I explain some positives and negatives if you are interested in what the game has to offer.

[h1][b]Pros:[/b][/h1]

[b]-Solid Gameplay Loop:[/b]
Despite it's incomplete state, you can get hours of gameplay by just focusing on improving in the races and moving through the main quest line. I appreciate this. It means that, most likely, anything that will be added to flesh out the game more will just make it more worth the experience. I have over 40 hours now and I'm not even finished with the main game.

[b]-Cute Model Style:[/b] 
The horses look like horses, and they have nice memorable designs. I like the human design too, even if there isn't a lot of variety right now its a good place to start.

[b]-Beautiful Environments:[/b]
Self explanatory.

[b]-Breeding is Fun:[/b]
I am not one for waiting games but I love the breeding aspect. The new foal is also rewarding, especially when it outperforms the parents or just looks pretty.

[b]-The Horse Trust System Is Satisfying:[/b]
 I love starting with a horse that will ignore my call for it, and ending with a horse that eagerly canters my way and whinnies excitedly when I'm around. It warms my heart.

[b]-Very Cozy:[/b]
This game is good for warm feelings. It's simple, the music is nice, the effort you put into your horses is worth it.

[b]-Good Challenge and Balance:[/b]
The races get difficult around Intermediate, and the difficulties afterwards really make you consider the importance of each stat--not just speed and jump. You end up adjusting training to meet the needs of the races, which I like. It's good that this game isn't a cake walk.

[b]-You Don't Micromanage Crops:[/b]
You plant your seeds, add fertilizer if you want, and then leave it alone for a few days. I like this because the horse aspect of the game requires a lot of attention, and micromanaging crops would be tedious along with that. I love games that make me manage my crops, but I would hate it here for that reason. Glad its the way it is here!


[h1][b]Cons:[/b][/h1]

[b]-New Game, Same Story:[/b]
'You must become #1 for your family, your town, etc. Here's this ranch for you to do that. There's some magic, too. Have fun.' Not exactly original or improved upon [b]so far[/b].

[b]-Still In an Empty State:[/b]
This means that there's no point in interacting with NPCs outside of the main quest right now. They are only there to unlock instructions and tell you what to do. There is no 'liveliness' to the game outside of the horses filling your ranch. All human NPC 3D designs and movements are very robotic and stiff, which makes this a bit more obvious. No events outside of racing. No reason to focus on specific types of crops for George (the Merchant of this game) because he doesn't put requests for anything specific beyond the main quest like he said he would. No other animals, no other memorable interactions. I figure this is will change eventually as more content comes in, but that's the state right now.

[b]-Active Foraging and Active Exploration Seems Pointless Right Now:[/b]
I mean 'active' as in going from trail to trail looking for materials to forage or areas to explore. I, personally, have found no reason to spend a lot of time outside of town and home when I have a training area on the ranch and a spot to plant seeds. I hope this gets fixed because travel seems inconvenient unless its for NPC or statue visits. There is very little point to enjoy the environments for themselves, which makes for a lot of wasted space. This will very likely change over time as more is added but its noticeable now.

[b]-Very Stiff Human Movements:[/b]
Your human model rides like a robot and doesn't seem very human from the stiffness of their bodies. All humans have no facial expressions, just an empty stare. I don't care for accuracy for riding movements or facial expressions, but I do want some show of motion that seems 'natural' for a human body and conversation. Right now there is none and its very noticeable.

[b]-Racing Alone:[/b]
This can just be me, but when I heard my character was racing, I thought they would be racing NPCs, not a time-minimum, so I was a bit disappointed by that. Eventually, I got over it, but this was something that made me a liiiittle sad.

[b]-Buggy:[/b]
Expected for an EA, but still necessary to mention for those looking to buy. I have found a lot of bugs, but only one that has stopped all my daily progress completely. Most of them are just funny or mildly inconvenient. Most of them have simple work-arounds, and you can find help for the less obvious ones in the Steam Discussions.

[b]-Redundant:[/b]
Because there isn't a lot of other things to do in the game, it becomes very grindy. You will spend most of your time training horses and-or breeding them every day. That means doing the same actions every day for most of the day. If this doesn't appeal to you, I suggest waiting for the game to get some seasonal events and such.",1

That said after story the game mode to partake in is the patrols and it just aint great, theyre repetetive random missions that spawn in currently limited bath of open world, completing them pays small amount of money and bump world level, but then theres also resources which require you to go around looking for rocks and piles of scrap to get materials to craft new items.

Good thing about those is that specific resource types spawn at different parts of map.
Whats bad is the amount required to craft anything useful.

To progress to higher tiers of gear you need to complete more and more missions before going to collect, ive never seen resource nodes to respawn and you will need a couple runs, so far its been 3-6 per item.
This gets tedious by mk 2 out of 5, where 2 missions + collect takes about 20 minutes per run.
But you also need levels to even unlock new gear types, and it doesnt tell you what youll unlock, so stuff you craft now might be made obsolete by new frame or guns later on

So far core loop is just horrible, its horrible grind which encourages you to spend money to skip it.
If devs manage to introduce more interesting content than these random missions this might be good, but so far it simply aint and from player numbers as theyre now this will possibly never happen.",0

At first, the pop-ins and late textures really got to me, but I can deal with that for now simply because of how good this game feels on the road. I currently play on realistic settings with manual gears and with ABS, Traction, Anti-wheelie, and EB turned up mostly.. you can really brake hard and get a lot of acceleration out of the corners. I plan to go no-assists eventually, but for now I'm just having too much fun setting ghosts to beat later. 

I would like to see some more graphical improvements in the future, but again.. Gameplay is king. Very few games give you the legit feeling for what it's like to ride a superbike on the open road.

The game is still exceedingly challenging and forces you to make sacrifices as you go through each instance, and some of the changes and additions are welcome (I particularly enjoy the friendship/rivalry system).

Though I'm still not entirely sold on the (relatively) non-persistent nature of runs (there is, for example, no home base that you work to upgrade, like the village in the original DD), the way in which heroes are upgraded is satisfying in its own right. I think future balance updates and hot fixes will make this game even more enjoyable.",1

Scoreboard while in game is default ""Z"". from this menu you can mute individuals so as not to lose team comms as a whole. If had to mute a few trolls.

But god damn playing it is actually really fun and engaging. I was expecting a super clunker of a ""retro game."" But no, its controls are tight and responsive with good sound effects and feedback, and despite being a diablo-like ARPG, each of the enemies telegraph their effects, and you start off with a dodge roll.

138683335,1268750,"[h1] A loving tribute to the source material [/h1]

Been waiting for this game since announcement and was not disappointed! Guns and gadgets feel and sound as they did from the movie, fighting off the hoards of detailed bugs while on the outpost walls of a beautiful desolate planet truly the stuff of nightmares, and the chaos of a 16 man team getting pushed back on retreat to the dropship gives you all the hallmarks of the Starship troopers experience. Imagine all that wrapped up in a musical score that pays homage to the 1997 Film (The hands down classic and best) and you have an experience above and beyond anything thats come out since ST: Marauder. AND IT TOPS THAT BECAUSE ITS MULTIPLAYER. 

Now for the buggy stuff as far as early access:
- The controller support works but the settings such as senstivity need fine tuning as all you have is general sensitivity and no ADS/ hipfire sensitivity or separate X/Y axis sensitivity, you can get by on the settings they have but keybinds cannot be altered for controller even though the UI allows you to attempt to change them (made me think it was a issue of my controller)
- Graphics, i understand its still in development technically but I want to note that the game runs great when theres alot of onscreen enemies and particle effects, HOWEVER; when you jet pack jump you get alot of screentearing and it alil jarring, sure I dont use V-sync or G-Sync but I find it strange that it ONLY happens when Jet pack jumping and none of the other times where looking around fast would do that. 
- ADS vs. Hip fire, there is no difference in bullet spread/range/ or recoil and honestly using the Iron sights on the Morita rifles is totally pointless rn as far as optimal gameplay, I instinctively do it until the recoil sends my gun jiggling and then exit ADS to find myself hip-fire sniping enemies, as of right now it seems more like a proof of concept for the ADS rather than any type of real benefit.

I assume at least 2/3 are bugs rn and as a whole rate this early access a whopping 5 Cows out of 6 Warrior Bugs. Definitely worth the purchase now and always. IM FROM BUENOS AIRES AND I SAY KILL EM ALL!!!

I think the team building this game has a lot of work ahead of them. The map is massive, but exploring is repetitive and tedious. The tech tree needs a complete overhaul unless the devs genuinely dislike their playerbase. I looked through the roadmap for this game and it might go somewhere, but probably not for a few more years. It lacks content, it lacks polish for the UI, it lacks graphical optimized performance, it lacks clarity when it comes to the tech tree, it lacks balancing in terms of the loot you find in abandoned outposts, and it lacks enjoyment for longer playthru's. This game could fix many of these issues quickly, but the fact it has been in testing for so long and it hasn't, doesn't give me hope. So WAIT, spend your money on games that are finished, or at least that can be enjoyed throughout the development process. This may not be one of them.",0

The aesthetic design and progression are very enjoyable. Levelingup gear and finding new loots is the best!

I have had this on my Wishlist for Months and I was very excited to finally get to play it...

But, there are some issues... The complete lack of controller Support is sort of lame. 
The Hitboxes are very difficult to nail down. I have turned my mouse speed up to the maximum and still struggle to get my cursor in position in time.
The Delay on the right mouse button to use the shield is very frustrating, there is a delay on the deployment of the shield which makes it very easy to miss.
There are no Trajectory lines when reflecting objects and so that can cause them to fly in all sorts of directions.
Trying to attack a target while having to simultaneously pull back for a block and factor in delay for shield deployment or to deflect a projectile away or towards the sender feels incredibily stressful and is very difficult.

The concept is interesting which you need to expand and upgrade your train to get the benefits of your journey, combating enemy when reaching some checkpoint and gain other resources.

138527629,2414210,"this is TERRIBLE. first of all, it is not even CLOSE to a recreation of the classic text twist web game. sure, it had six letters that you have to unscramble, but that's where the similarities end. there's a reason for that, but i'll get into it towards the end of the review.

you get two modes, timed and untimed. timed gives you two minutes to try and fill in all the words, and your high score is saved at the end of the two minutes. untimed lets you fill in the whole board with no time limit. untimed doesn't really work that well because once you finish a board it doesn't do anything. no new board with new letters, no congratulations screen, nothing. timed mode doesn't work because the score system gets broken if you bother with untimed mode even once. for some reason, your score is saved in untimed mode as well, and it only shows one singular score on the menu, rather than a different score for both modes. that means you can play untimed once, get the max score of 27000, quit to the menu, and then going for high scores in timed mode becomes pointless.

on top of that, they somehow screwed the basic gameplay of text twist in this version. for one, there are so few boards that i ran into repeats multiple times in my meager 30 minutes of gameplay. either i got REALLY unlucky or there just aren't that many sets for the game to randomly choose from. second, and worst of all, are the boards you fill in. plain and simple, they suck. not all words that are possible to make from a set of letters are used in any given board. that doesn't mean you can just pick however many words you can think of to fill them in, no no no, that would actually make sense. instead they have VERY SPECIFIC words that can be used. that means that some real obvious, basic words just will not work when you try them. this issue is most prevalent with three letter words, but there were a few examples of four or even five letter words that didn't work either. on top of all that, you can't even use the six letter word, despite every single set having a six letter word that you could make.

so what happens in a typical timed game is you type in the six letter word, and nothing happens because theres no spot for it. then, you type in a bunch of three and four letter words, only to realize some of the ones you put in didn't work. you try them again, and they still don't work, because for some reason, they just aren't in the game's word library. so you're like ""well what else am i supposed to fill in here?"" and you start typing every three letter combination you possibly can, and still end up missing a few because despite some obvious real words not being included, it's also filled with those obscure words you've never heard of. stuff like ""aal"". but sure, ""yaw"", a basic terminology in airplanes, doesn't count, or even ""mobile"", which is pretty ironic. then you run out of time with a pretty middling score, only for it to not matter beacuse you already maxed out the high score with an untimed game a while ago. then you start a new game and get a board you've already seen before and STILL can't fill it all in.

as if somehow butchering the gameplay of something as simple as text twist wasn't bad enough, the presentation also sucks. UI that looks like it was made for a mobile game in a 2023 PC release, super generic looking black times new roman text with no outlines or anything, no video options (not even a fullscreen toggle), letters get stuck if you start typing in words before they finish shuffling, and one ambient looping song that sounds oddly stressful. the charm of the REAL classic text twist is not present in this port, nor is the quality gameplay or variety. i loved classic text twist as a kid, and was excited when i saw it was coming to steam, but, despite the name, classic text twist this is not.

in fact, after looking into it a little more, i found out why this bares such little resemblance to the classic text twist it gets its name from. this is actually a port of a 2011 mobile game called Text Twist 2, which explains the funky UI.

Devs, if you're reading this, please be honest here. i feel like i got tricked into buying what i thought was going to be something completely different from what i got. if you had called this ""Text Twist 2"", which you should've, since that's what it is, then i wouldn't have gone into this game expecting a port of the original text twist. if it's possible to do so, please change the game's name on steam and update it to show the game's original title.",0

The graphics are also good, adding to the overall experience. It's worth noting that there aren't many Korean games in this genre, so it's nice to see this one exist.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, there are a few issues that could be addressed. Firstly, the deathmatch mode seems to end too quickly in the my opinion. It can feel frustrating to save up for expensive weapons only to have the game end after a few shots. Increasing the maximum points from 120 to a higher value, such as 250, could provide a more satisfying and prolonged gameplay experience.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another issue mentioned is the falling animation, which sometimes forces the player to wait for a significant amount of time. This can be problematic because during this animation, there is a chance that another opponent may take advantage of the situation and shoot the player. Finding a way to minimize or optimize the falling animation would help to improve the overall flow and pace of the game.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall, the game seems promising for fans of third-person games like PUBG, and with some tweaks and improvements, it has the potential to become even better.

Would you like to know more? 

While early development and repetitive game play is a thing, its still a blast to play! This game has 1000% potential to become one of the top games. 
There is work to still be done, but just a few days in this thing is great. Runs good even cranked to ultra on my 3080. Well optimized. The format is fun. There is so much potential. 

Things they need to work on. Progression, XP, unlock system is ok, but it doesn't feel very rewarding. There is no character creation whatsoever. Even worse it seems to just randomly assign you a gender. While it doesn't matter much It does affect the voice of your character. Just a minor annoyance. Adding some skins and cosmetics is a must. 

The game captures the feel and is true to the source materials. 

Unless they dev and publisher trip and get brain damage along the way, there is no way they can mess this up. What they have is a perfect base with a fun topping. 

Devs! Keep doing what you are doing here! More maps, more mission types, some customization's for the characters, cosmetics. Put some story type missions with some of the movie characters might be a hit. 

I would like to see NPC reporters on the battle field following around random soldiers. Would like to see a mission to get the brain bug and drag it out.

Take a chance, it has a small bit if the Deep Rock appeal, but is more just straightforward fps class based shooter.

Gameplay - If you've played FC3 and above, you know exactly what to expect here. Instead of booting up and adding new things to your repertoire, this is more like coming home, after some time away. Depending on what you're looking for, this can be good or bad. A few different weapons and moves, but we pretty much stick to the formula or standard that was set before it. Personally, I have zero problem with that. It made it so easy to install and get right in to it.

Sound - With the new area you will be playing in, there's tons of mountains, water, ocean, rivers and so on, not the same as FC5 and it's amazing mountain peaks, but more like tropical mountains and so on. Got some real FC3 vibes. But you can hear every animal, footstep, people talking and so on and hear it crystal clear. The music is good as well. 2 things I really enjoy about the audio. 1 - Whether you play as the male or female, they have a voice now. One that fits the character perfectly. 2 - This one surprised me. While driving, a song came on over the radio and my character began to sing along with it. I know it means nothing for gameplay, but it seemed to immerse me a little more in the world.

If you're a fan of the FC series, you will find tons of stuff here to love but, you may find things not changed up enough from the last couple entries. There's not a lot of new mechanics, which I personally have no problem with, but others, who expect a game with a series such as FC, they will be let down by the lack of innovation. Also, having an animal partner, following you around and helping out, is nothing new, FC5 had the same mechanic. But, it's more refined this time around and they seem to be much smarter and a lot more useful.

Story - This, to me, is the best FC story since Vaas in Far Cry 3. 3 really being the game that won me over to the series, had an amazing story and Vaas was the biggest reason why. Far Cry 6, to me anyway, out does itself story wise and now has my favorite story of all, knocking 3 down a notch to the number 2 position. It didn't take long for me to lose myself in the world, in the characters, anticipating what may happen just around the corner. As a person who has read more comics and more books than your average Joe, 6 sucked me in, just like a good book you can't put down. I would play longer, even when I should go to bed because I didn't want to sleep, until the part of the story I was currently in, either ended, or switched gears a bit.

I wanted to give this a 5 star rating but, I went with a 4 because the lack of real innovation in the gameplay. It was as if, your character from Far Cry 5, moved to tropical islands and forests, to continue with his journey. The settings were different, the graphics even better, but it was most like I had been treated to a really well made DLC, instead of a whole new game.

I recommend everyone giving it a shot. Whether you're a FC fan, or fan of FPS games in general. There's lots to love, lots to do and it's all in a beautiful world. The story alone can capture your mind or imagination and encourage you to keep moving, finding out more as you go. Give this one a try, you wont regret it.",1

138529198,1268750,"It is a decent enough game but it needs A LOT more content even after the 1 year road map. DRG is the gold standard of PVE team shooters. DRG has 8 modes or more, fee content every 8 months-ish and 24 unique modifiable weapons across 4 classes and something like 12 biomes of random generating missions that feel different and that is all for 25 usd. I think Killing floor 2 also has a pretty wide birth of content (10 classes,4-5 bosses, 5 ish unique weapons per class that come with the game more if you pay for them, and a ton of official/community maps)  This game as it stands cost the same price and requires a lot less team work, Has the one map, 2 modes with more planed, only 3 classes, about 7 primary firearms planned but only 2-3 unique per class that cannot themselves be modified , Like 5 secondaries that are the same across all of the classes, Mostly generic perks and utilities per class. Right now its definitely not worth 25 usd as is and after the one year lets say all this stuff comes out that is planned. It would still be hard for me to tell some one to go and buy it over other games like my examples. I got board within the 2 hours here because i already found myself doing the same exact thing over and over. While i have spent 170 hours of mostly enjoyable time on DRG and because it has so much verity it can be played longer, more enjoyably, and still did not feel like i am doing the exact same thing because i am doing it in different ways. 

My recommendation to the dev is: This is not a bad game, it has very good core game play and i can see the effort here. You need to find a way to incorporate more verity  then what is currently on the road map as it stands many of your playerbase would get board and leave eventually. The Fans of the IP world stay for a bit but would that be enough to sustain the game so they could keep telling others to buy it before even the fan base gets board ? The people that currently bought your product are people that bought it for the IP (probably), if you would like to reach a wider audience verity is KEY. Another suggestion is: generally servers require maintenance fees on your end but you might want to look into the possibility of allowing people to host their own servers on their own equipment  that way you don't have to pay for them.

Sorry that is just my takeaway as someone that does not really care about the IP but i do hope your team finds success in the endeavor to make this a fun experience. Just to clarify, I am not saying your game has to be infinite, Just that at 25 usd i would expect it to keep my attention and be enjoyable for at least 10 hours without getting dull and by the time an hour had past it was getting stale but that is just my experience.",0

Also, be aware, something I do not think they advertise anywhere until you download the game: This is more of an Alpha than it is an Early Access build. It is limited in how far you can progress and what you can do, containing only 6 missions and 1 open area, with a level cap of 25.

I encountered no major bugs.",1

138499094,669330,"This is a pretty addicting game. The rock, paper, scissors type of combat is great as you are constantly working to counter and predict the opponent. One mistake can cost you a round, yet there is enough room to turn things around and turn the tide in your favor. There are some balancing issues with some units being a bit stronger than others, same goes with the different start setups where some are just outright traps to avoid. I think 2v2 is great with friends. We haven't tried the survival mode yet but it sounds promising. I'm looking forward to future development and updates to see where things go. If you like strategy and/or auto-battlers then this is a great title to pickup and I definitely recommend it.",1
138499551,669330,"With this game being just released out of Early Access I do have to say its polished, and quite fun. It's somewhat basic right now on the battles you can do, but hopefully that will change as the game gets developed. I find myself getting bored after 4-5 battles online, I will turn it off for a bit but I always come back later to do some more battles. 

The Auto battling mechanic of the game is great, pathfinding of the AI controlling your units works well, no bugs from what I have seen so far. All of the units seem fairly balanced, and each unit has a unit that can counter it fairly well. 

I look forward to seeing what comes next with this game.",1

The fact that this is early access is insane to me. You could tell a ton of passion went into this and will continue to get attention and further development. The survey for the game shows the full scope/vison they have for this game.

CO-OP Outlast gameplay with phenomenal missions, progression, and other modes I have yet to discover.

The moment I got hit by a psychosis mine after running from a bad guy, into another bad guy, into the mine. Hearing my friend who was hiding under a desk next to me talk and his voice echo'ed as if I actually just got my world rocked. Barely can make out what they're saying. It was that moment, I knew I was playing a game that was developed with true passion and attention to detail.

+For including proximity chat (Highly recommend avoiding Discord or other third party voice chats)


I'd like to see increased difficulty in enemies. Though I have only done 1 Trial, it took 60 minutes for me and my bud to get through. The enemies could use some better perception and increased range before their attention falls off. Maybe this gets better as you progress more.

Update 2: The Yamato III was blown apart by missiles. Rest assured, the Yamato IV will have CIWS.

Update 3: I have been sacked because the majority of my budget has gone to these super battleships in the last decade (three of which were all sunk in their first battle), and now the IJN is nothing but a bunch of old ships in desperate need of refits and modernization and we can no longer compete with any of the other major powers

i rly dont care to boost and carry the world. its not my job.


there is 16 players in the field and on 3 day of release i seeen people troll very very VERY hard......  u build a bunker on a choke point some  guy will delete and put a random electrioc fence in the middel of nowhere.

no thanks the game is as good as the community and they not very good.

as i said 3 days after the game releases people making terrible mistakes.

making the game unplayble and UNFUN.

hence why i quit 2 days ago being lvl 30+

also running a 4000 euro pc and the lagg at end game is horrid also. 

game starts at 400 fps ultra settings at the end of the match running at 55 fps....

thats how i sum up the game. ill copy paste this into a review i guess. 

can not recommend this game whatsoever!! the community are TERRIBLE 16 year old millennial/trolls that never even seen the movie.

138590636,1899060,"I first played this game back in the 7th grade, years ago. I showed it to all of my friends and we spent hours in front of my old house computer squished together on one chair doing voices for the characters and switching who was in charge of controls. This game definitely influenced my and my friends lives and interests. I've found myself drawn to similar art styles, aesthetics, and decor, and enjoy wearing lolita fashion, which I now realize is because of this games influence lol. Safe to say this is a core part of my childhood and I am absolutely ecstatic that this is getting a re-release so many years later. I think it is well deserved. Thank you so much for releasing this game, I don't think I'd be who I am now without it. I recommend this game to anyone I love it with all my heart.",1
138590626,2403570,"I loved this story. I thought it was interesting and emotionally satisfying, surprisingly so, given how short the game is outside of puzzling time. The game itself looks and feels pretty and polished (the artwork is especially good imo).

Puzzle-wise, some of them are quite challenging, even punishing at times (there were some that I spent a couple hours on each, and a couple that I gave up on), but they are seriously satisfying if you can work through them without a guide. The difficulty options let you do easy, medium, or hard versions of each puzzle, or bypass them entirely if you just want the story.

Overall, a super enjoyable game. The original version was impressive for a game jam game, and this version is updated and fine-tuned, so it's even better. Definitely worth playing imo.

The upgrade path to everything feels disconnected from it's implementation as you for some reason choose what upgrades you can get in a different place from where you apply them. I guess there's a story reason for this, but I have no idea what the story is. DD1 had a real sense of place and was filled with character and meaning. DD2 replaces this with a kind of empty gothic horror. DD2 is very beautiful, no doubt about that, but it feels so flat.
The combat is probably good once you decipher the glyphs, but I don't think I have the patience for it. Maybe I was just as confused when I started playing DD1, but that game had something that kept me going that is just absent here.",0

138684155,1451810,"I do not recommend the Lego racing game due to excessive micro-transactions. It's a letdown for players who love the franchise.

My conclusion to this is, after playing almost every LEGO game out there with a total playtime of over 500hrs, with the worst games of the franchise: like Lego Worlds and Lego Bricktales, this is definitely something else.

I still have faith in the future of this game, yet when i played it for testing, the driving felt clumsy and not refined, which really put me off. And for some reason you're not even able to change controller inputs. God knows why.

I wouldn't mind their system of micro transactions (because id prob farm money other ways), but with an engine like this i could barely enjoy driving. 

I remember when i heard the news about LEGO games getting different production studios, rather than being bound to
Tt Games, but this i definitely not what i was expecting. 

Yet, for all the fellow LEGO games friends out there, 
lets hope for a better future for these games.
