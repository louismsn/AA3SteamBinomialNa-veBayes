138685779,1304930,"I seriously doubt this was play tested at all. Unbalanced and its way too hard to be fun, i get that its meant to be hard but theres a line between fun hard and frustrating hard.

138680882,2369390,Soulless game. Literally a downgrade when compared to previous games from the Far Cry series. Besides Giancarlo Esposito I don't think there's anything good about it sadly.,0
138686648,754890,"I am a backer of this game and I cannot recommend it at this stage.  As tempting as the promise of a new Riven an the likes of it may be to some - this is not it. My review is based on the non VR version nad it contains no spoilers.

In short:

It is a bugfest full of gliches that are sucking the joy out of the vistas you can see and the riddles that are there to be solved by you. 
I mean it has a restore function to get you back into a save position when you are stuck or have been falling out of the map. 
I have been stuck, I have been falling through the map and Cyan seem to be aware and okay with it, why else would they offer such an odd function? This is unacceptable. Storywise seems unfinsihed as well if you are luckly enough to get the narrator talking to you. 

Cyan, pls. fix and finish the game. Until then I cannot recommend it to anyone.",0
138683628,2078510,"Simple, addictive and clever. A combination of the greatness of Q-Bert, Monkey Ball and V-Ribbon all in the creator's own funkycute style. Fantastic level design. A real gem",1

Minor issues here and there but dev already patched some of the reported issues.

Congrats bundev, it was a worthy wait.",1

138676383,1730250,"I like the game, it's easy to get the hang of it and build up a large tilestack and a lot of points. I have to not recommend it at the current price point though, because after about 6 hours I discovered that you can finish the game. Once you've built all structures, you will be prompted to build a statue that ends the game. I wanted to keep going, but that's not an option. I understand there needs to be an end in order to compete with highscores, but I really can't recommend the game without a mode where you can keep going.",0

138678284,1730250,"It is similar to Dorfromantik, but I enjoyed playing it.

138588928,2287980,"懂的都懂内容去搜一下kagurafan就可以看到啦！

《懵懂少女惠子》的后续作品，这次的主人公是惠子的妹妹悠贵。
游戏风格也是继承了前作，几乎没有战斗系统，跟随主线提示推动剧情，并触发更多特殊剧情，能看出作者的画工进步了不少，非常推荐喜欢前作的玩家购买。",1
138678997,2184680,"Downloaded the demo in a heartbeat since I already wishlisted the game when it was announced. Overall the game felt good. The tutorial is clunky, and the text blocks the screen if we don't follow the instruction, which a quick restart can fix. Still it's worth fixing to make sure we can see the screen.  

Some feedback:  
1. Getting the synergy can be difficult as we are fighting RNG for both units AND weapons. Maybe some free rerolls in upgrade can be great for the first couple levels.  
2. Are there even enough units of certain types to spawn? There are many occasions that I'm waiting for the last unit for the final synergy but that never came. Since this is a PvE game, maybe there can be some background change to spawn chance if we are chaining certain combos. i.e. if we got many units of one type, increase the spawn rate of that type slightly.  
3. Money boosting units seem more like a death trap as they don't give much DPS boost and are rare to spawn, so we basically will be sitting at 3 unique units for a long time and not really getting the full benefits.  
4. Bosses have way too much HP, especially Mother.  
5. HP bar display on non-boss enemies would be nice as an option.
6. Some weapons are just better/worse. Static Charge is way less useful than, say, Creeping Scythe, due to the small radius.   
7. Knockback effect usually tank our DPS because it keeps knocking enemies outside of our range, especially for guns. Maybe knockDOWN would be better?  
8. The pickup radius can be a bit larger...  
9. Would be nice to have arrows pointing to bosses. This is for finding the boss that looks like a big tree so we can quickly find out where it spawned.
10. Needs a countdown/duration bar on the team specials, so we can see how much time we got left. For example, invincibility only lasts 10 secs, so we need to see when it stops.
11. Guns are strong early game but falls off in late game, syntech is weak early game but scales well into late game. But the game discourages mixing both and rewards us for specializing into one group. I feel this is a missed opportunity to have a mixed attack mode.
12. Upgrades weapons/units should be sold for more money. Say we have a lvl 3 Soldier that we want to swap for Decoy... and that'd set us back quite a bit.
13. Combining units overwrites our weapons! This is terrible as sometimes we are using the units as weapon storage, but we need to remove the weapons first if we don't want them to disappear.
14. We need more weapon slots! Or at least a ""draft area"" where we can temporarily move/swap our gear. Seriously 4 weapon slots is not enough, give us like 6 or more!
15. Synergy combo + death = GG. This is more apparent in late game. The moment our units start going down, they'd die quicker because we lost our synergy. This creates a downward spiral and often it's hard to recover from. Please give us some ways to comeback from a broken synergy at late game. And very often we went down because we are not doing well, so trying to salvage near where we went down is hard. Maybe like let us keep our synergy if we are next to the wreckage? Or some ways to comeback at least once a game, like maybe a free revive once per game.",1
138681452,1159690,"The game is OK, with the tendency to be great.
Short description: it's RAFT on RAILS!

138686486,2369390,"Im impressed of how many known songs they have put into this game. That's really nice to have songs you actually know IRL in the car and helicopter when playing!

VIVA LA VIDA LOCA!!!",1
138686305,2369390,"As you would guess it plays just like any other Far cry game. Is that a bad thing? Not at all. The couple of new things they added makes it feel somewhat fresh. I've only played 30 hours and haven't completed the first zone so there is plenty to do. The story so far is also good along with its characters, to me their not that forget full at all. So it gets a big thumbs up from me",1
138686527,2369390,"good fun, just wish the map wasn't so big",1

I wish developers luck and hope that more people give it a shot.

For now, it's a positive review of my limited time playing it.",1
138591022,1934780,"Awesome game. Feels really good to play. Tons of options on weapons, abilities, tactics. My friends and I tried it out tonight, and we played casual for 4 hours straight. Really neat ideas coming together in this game, give it a shot.",1

138685271,2353790,"Really disappointing. The third level is crazy as the tiles randomly fall away without any obvious reason and the help video about ""broken connection"" tiles doesn't help at all.

138686440,754890,"Loved Obduction, and I'm loving this one too. Well done Cyan! I really enjoy your world-building!

On a side note, while the game is awesome, I found it a little short (easier puzzles than previous Cyan games), but I believe that's because of VR.",1
138678949,1940340,"Darkest Dungeon 2 is really great game and feel very much like a version 2 compared to the first game (as it should be, it does not feel like a re-skin of the previous game as many AAA games out there).
So many improvements have been made and a lot of clunkiness from the first game have been reworked or removed.
If you liked DD1 you can easily ignore most of negative reviews as the majority of them are pretty unfair, in my opinion.",1
138681667,1940340,"This is a difficult game to review. For me, personally, in terms of lore, setting, gameplay and game mechanics, all the things I would name as a positive for DD2 - DD1 does it better. The one big plus this game has over the first one is the character art and -animation. It does look great!

I was really hyped for DD2 and I've had quite a lot of fun with it already - I'm also going to play it more for sure - but if I had to recommend either Darkest Dungeon 1 or this game to anyone who remotely shares my tastes (given that they would only get one of them), I'd recommend the former without a second thought.

Don't get me wrong, Darkest Dungeon 2 is a decent game (arguably with a lot of bugs, comparably awful performance on even high-end computers and general flaws - but I'm sure there are many patches to come), it just doesn't live up to its predecessor.

(Also, if you're planning to play both games, no matter what - go for this one first and leave the better one for second to avoid possible disappointment.^^)",0

138590126,758690,"33 hours in, I have achieved so much, but still have so much to do. The game is incredibly fun and in depth. I have been streaming it all week with my chat also getting involved to help problem solving. I understand not everyone has a chat. but if you would like to see raw game play with mistakes and elation of achieving then the link is below. 

The Bottom line, there is always something to work towards and the progression feels just right in my own opinion (I don't speak for all). Upgrades feel like worthy upgrades and expansion feels rewarding. Enjoy and discover your inner Vulcan as once you use logic winning will ensue.

130731394,1649630,"I really like roguelikes of all kinds, but... this one is just absolutely not grabbing me at all.

I dislike the stamina system. Half of the time you can't do anything. And managing it just sucks the fun out of this game for me. It's like all weapons (melee and ranged) are like those guns without ammo, but with constant need to cool them down after several taps.

Enemy design is also very basic and if you fall down out of the arena - you're dead. It's really easy to fall when you're trying to dodge 10 enemies charging at you while you are constantly on cooldown.

In other words - I don't like the game flow.

Oh well. To the next one.",0
138591431,1934780,"Desync is horrible, movement is horrible. Two most basic things that need to work to make a game playable and yet again they somehow have not figured this out.",0
138591800,1934780,"The gun gameplay is clunky, most kits don't do anything effective which is why your always going to see the same people played (Jack, Sik and Rose). The game is basically rogue company except all people do is run into site with an smg and spray you down (which isn't fun to verse or play against) at its current state I wouldn't recommend playing this game, if you want tactical gameplay thats more fun just go play r6 or fortnite",0
138590435,1783280,"Been slightly following this game for some time, and it looked really cool.  Then I saw it fully released, and I was in the market to buy a new game, and wanted a game that looked retro.  This almost like the Diablo 1 vibe, but older kind of thing, and this fit the bill, Playstation (1) graphics (which is great).  I thought the enemy types were fun and interesting, and seeing some old favorites I used to know back in the day (The bouncing Stiff zombies (I always forget the name, even though there is a ""Lore"" section in the game that shows the various enemies and their names as you come across them)).  

Then I played with my friend in remote play, would LOVE online play but I know this game was developed by two people (I imagine two brothers), and heard they are seeing if this game gets popular enough for it.  But I think it could really use it.  The screens in single player are full screen (Inventory, skill section, etc.) BUT, in multiplayer it separates it so you can have multiple screens open at a time.  

The builds, wow the builds, the amount of things you can do in the game is quite insane.  My friend made an army of minions, while I made a giant earthquake spell just rife with ""larger radius"" skills attached and it's just bedlam, it's great.  The amount of ""editing"" with the skill grid is almost daunting, but really makes me excited to tinker around in it.  And then you get to the glyph tree side of it?  Nuts.  Just nuts.  It might seem daunting, like I said, but there are just so many things you can do, I say take a deep breath and fiddle around, as you can change the skills in and out as you go, no need to go somewhere special to respec and stuff.  

Also it starts you out slow, with only so many spaces in both grids (skill and glyph grids) so it's not overwhelming, and it was quite easy to pick up how it all worked for me.  Discovering things that made me go... ""OH wow, I can do that too!?!?  What!??!""  yeah, quite fun.

I think these two did an amazing job so far, and I really dig the music and the creatures and the old school graphics, I'm sure the various sound effects will lodge deep in my brain like the ol' Diablo and Diablo 2 sound effects have.  And it being 4 players?  I can't even imagine, it was wild with 2 players!  And I'm pretty sure (didn't really test it, just something I noticed) they drop more loot when playing coop.  Now you don't have instanced loot (how loot works in this game is when something drops, we all can see it, an whoever gets it gets it), but it's easy enough to be like ""Oh, this would work great with my friend's setup"" and just toss it to them.  Never saw a problem with it so far (got to level 16). 

So try it out, it's not too expensive, and I think it's quite a steal for what is inside this very interesting game.  You can tell the developers really put a lot into the game, and care a lot about the game.",1
138684876,669330,"So far I love this game. It is well balanced so there are no completely overpowered units that you cannot counter.

138681912,2369390,"Great value game at the £12 launch price. Not worth full price as this game is true to the far cry formula in the open world, taking outposts and moving towards end game BUT the whole thing is so under whelming and easy.
Movement sucks - Can be are to mount/climb ledges, interaction distance (for a game where u can loot for weeks) is to short meaning looting is not intuitive and finicky, Slide is faster than running (and you need special armour to improve sprint speed)
Rank system is broken - i had so many initial quests that i when i got level 5 i realised there were still half the world map to uncover at level 4 and below. i also found the mission menu difficult to understand what was a main story mission and what was a side quest.
Best weapon in the game - the first one! I cant understand why guns i have been forced to collect are noticeable worse than the stock BR which will 1 tap level 7 enemies with no helmet
Workbenches are everywhere - with nothing to do on them

Well made game that is just boring if you have played farcry before",1
138681482,669330,"Incredibly deep mech auto-battler.

This game kicks my a**. But I still come back for more. The strategy requires attention and tactics on several fronts. Basic gameplay is to counter the enemy unit choices with your choices. Unit positioning will make or break any plan you have, regardless of which units you've deployed. This further develops into flanking, which allows you to place units on the flanks of enemy territory after turn one. Next, you have one-shot items that could shift the balance of power just enough to win in an area where you're under-powered. Missile traps, force fields, and air-dropped single-use units. Not to mention lightning storms, acid carpet bombing, even nukes. Besides all this tactical planning, you need to decide when to expand or defend your armies, or upgrade veteran units to their next level. Failing to level the correct units will leave you being slaughtered by enemy units that have out-paced your own.

The game opens with a choice of starting bonuses, like extra resources, extra units, bonus speed, etc etc. Most of these if not all can be picked up during pre-round bonus selections. Your strategy can be jump-started with these perks.

As if this all wasn't enough to make the game extremely deep, you also have four abilities you can choose for each unit type. You unlock them during the early stages of playing the game, and they amount to the buffs you give your units over time. These buffs can be purchased at any time, though each purchase pushes the cost of the remaining abilities up. Some of the abilities scale with level, some are absolute.

If you wonder why you're getting your a** handed to you over and over again, its because you could lose (or win) based on your skill with any of these aspects of the game.

Overall, the meta includes basically the following;

Unit placement, flanking, single-use equipment, unit selections, leveling units, unit ability loadouts, resource management, and pre-round buff selections.

Its one of those games where you *know* you could do better. Winning feels satisfying. Even losing quite often, I still have fun playing the game.

If fighting people 1v1 isn't your thing, you can also do epic 2v2 battles, where two playing fields are joined adjacent to one another, and once one side defeats its opponent, the remaining units head over to the opposite side to fight their ally. Players can even deploy some gameplay mechanics on their ally's side, tipping the balance of power. Units flanking on the joined edge of the battlefields may even attack the opposite field before attacking on their own field, if their targeting is drawn there first.

Overall, the game is excellent, the balance is tight, and though many will kick and scream because of how hard it is to play against people who have ironed out their strategies, you *will* start to get it eventually.

You can always play solo games against bots if you just want to enjoy the tactics gameplay without the intensity of human players.

Don't feel like playing but still want more? You can spectate matches between high level players and vote on the outcome, which will earn you an Insight rating. A sort of game within the game.

10/10 would lose 19 out of 20 games again.",1

138590456,1934780,"Holy fuck, there's so much wrong here, but there is potential with this game.

I had a bit of fun with this game, but the amount of bugs I got so far is not worth playing right now. The matchmaking is already bad enough, but the first time I booted up the game, already I almost had a seizure. The game freaked out with it's flashing colors and I couldn't stop it. I had to close and reopen the game just to make it stop. At least an epilepsy warning would've at least help.

I'm not trying to be negative like ""early access = bad"" or something like that. I'm just trying to voice my unhappiness about the game so far and what I want the devs to fix.

138675420,1268750,"This game is doomed, and not because of the devs. The players leaving feedback and suggestions are mostly children or braindead adults who have never played a FPS game or a game that requires team work. Tons of the suggestions are coming from people who want the game to have features from completely different genres. I literally had multiple arguments with this one guy who was saying no to weapon reworks, scoreboard, ability to mute specific people via scoreboard, and squad icons next to name tags. His entire argument was ""I worked for 2K Games for 2 years,"" the people who make the NBA and WWE games, which in case you didn't know, doesn't relate to FPS in the slightest (except for borderlands 3). To dig in my point even more, it wasn't just him that disagreed with adding some basic fundamentals like muting or a scoreboard, about 4/5 people disagreed. This game is screwed, good luck devs, but you'd need a new community if you want this game to be popular a year from now. Only like 1/8th of the suggestions actually make sense and don't make the game insanely easy to the point that toddlers could win just by pressing W.

138675827,1268750,"It's good fun but it's a very bare-bones experience in early access. You drop in, rush the base and the ARC generator - both are receptacles for ore and gas respectively - and then wait to see where the ore and gas nodes spawn. Then, you can choose which of these resources to go to in order to activate them, withdraw their resources once the requisite time has elapsed, and then run back to base to deposit them. Bug spawns crop up everywhere and will make this difficult for you, and sticking with your teammates is vital... squad assignments are meaningless, however.

Depositing all the gas to the ARC generator starts a two-minute build period, on completion of which the Bug waves will start to attack your base, targeting the ARC generator. However, without ore, you cannot build any defences, and therefore players must focus on ore collection over gas at first (if they want to survive the match, at least.)

That's about it for the ARC game mode, but this can only be accessed by reaching level 5, and for that you have to play the AAS game mode. I haven't touched that since unlocking ARC. As aforementioned: It's bare-bones in the sense that it's repetitive, but many games are.

The classes are very strange and a point of contention for me. The Hunter class has a jetpack. The Bastion class has a fortify ability that erects a waist-high shield around them, which is apparently impervious to 8-foot-tall arachnid attacks. The Operator class can carry a canister of ore/gas and still remain combat effective, can heal people or supply ammo, has an auto-resurrect drone which simply prevents death and, to top it off, has access to the scoped rifle at level 2... and later on a grenade launcher, which admittedly is crap.

With respect... it feels like this monumental imbalance in utility was not looked at in the run up to the EA release. 

All that aside, when I first saw the trailer for this I was raring to play as a rank-and-file trooper, none of this class-based rubbish. Perhaps a system like the old Star Wars: Battlefront games could be introduced, where players begin as grunts but can obtain specialised weaponry/classes by completing objectives/performing well. It should be noted that specialised weaponry can already be acquired via objectives, and that these are limited in number and easily lost on death.

The level of cooperation needed is good but this should nonetheless always be refined where possible. Getting into a communicative squad is a pleasure - playing with silent lone wolves is a chore. Running off alone is a death sentence (unless your auto-resurrection drone is active, obviously.)

One big issue I experienced at the start was choppiness during the final stages of a mission, I guess due to the number of arachnids on-screen - the frames really started to suffer. I would even accept fewer spawned arachnids if they were individually buffed up a bit. I think this has been fixed a little in patches, but still... talk about the one game where you don't want multiple enemies on screen to cause frame drops!

Squad-based weaponry would be superb. Bases are frequently assailed by distant grenadier-bugs that cannot be seen, and to which there is no counter unless they move into view. This is perfect as it is, barring the absence of countermeasures: Perhaps in the future we may enjoy guided missile systems, mortar platforms or close air support? Something that requires a time investment to learn and operate.

Graphically ST:E is tremendous and stylistically very well-researched, a clear labour of love and skill. The guns look and feel great, the sounds are spot on, the environment of the map we have right now is expansive and great to engage in. It's also lacking in a few areas and in certain cases this sadly cannot be attributed to an early-access release - the classes really needed a few more minutes in the oven.

The developers have expressed no intention of implementing mod support or a server browser. That one really needs some thinking about, and thinking's the thing I don't do. I'm just here to fight.

But in terms of game mechanics, you can see this is where it went wrong. The budget went all in the visual aspects of things but the gameplay is just terrible. The abilities and ultimates of some of the characters honestly feel like they have zero impact, and I end up mostly never using them. There is zero cooldown to your ultimates as well, something I never quite understood. Half of the important things to do to understand the game aren't explained in the tutorial. The maps were clearly designed for their visual aspect and not their gaming aspect as they offer clear advantage for one the teams depending on if they start attacking or defending first (one of the maps starts with a team behind an enormous building on which they can reach the roof to snipe people, while the other team starts out in the open extremely exposed?).  And so many more things that lack in this game. 
It's too bad. Visually it is beautiful but seeing a product being so close to being finished with these mechanics just shows it doesn't have much potential. For it to work it would have to be completely reworked on the gameplay part.",0
138686423,2008100,My favorite version of Excel,1
138686729,2008100,"Rule the Waves 3 just like its predecessors combines the AAA graphics of Windows 2000 with the learning curve of arch linux.

If you are a new player, you have to ask yourself some questions before buying:
1: Do I need fancy graphics?
If the answer is yes - this obviously isn't your game. However it has to be noted that the ship models genuinely look a lot better and more detailed than in older games (still in the same style though).

2: Am I allergic to reading?
If the answer is yes - not your game. RTFM is probably the best advice I can give to new players. It's well written and explains a lot of the deeper systems of the game in a way that makes sense. You will also do a ton of reading in game.

3. What constitutes a good UI to me?
Okay, this one is a bit more difficult. As a developer myself, I *love* the UI in this game. It is simple but extremely effective and allows you to do everything you want *quickly*. There are also hotkeys for all sorts of actions. I much prefer this to the bloated and unresponsive UIs of other games in the same niche (looking at you, UaD).
But yeah, it looks like Excel.

4. Can I accept losing?
In this game, especially if you are new but also later on, there will be situations where you will get beaten by the AI. Sometimes you made a mistake, sometimes there really wasn't anything you could do. Once torpedo ranges grow and especially when carriers enter the mix, sometimes your enemy will get lucky and you won't. 
Alternatively, the leader(s) of your nations may make stupid decisions that make your job a lot harder.
You are playing as the head of the navy, you are not in control of everything. If you can accept that and want like to play a role Rule the Waves will be great for you.

5. Do I like to micromanage?
If you do - this is your game. If you don't - good news! In RtW3 some of the systems can be automated a lot better than in older ediions. You will still have to manage a lot of things though, don't worry.

If you enjoyed the older iterations of this franchise, this one won't disappoint you too. For players of the old parts the new tech and additional systems that allow for even more micromanagement are probably the main selling points.

Making promises for the future is of course always a tricky thing with game releases but I do want to add that NWS have a *very* good track record when it comes to maintaining their games. Rule the Waves received bugfixes and content updates until RtW 3 got announced (I think one final version after that even). 
Devs are very active on the forums (which I can recommend you use, lots of great advice there), listen to feedback and are apparently already working on the first update.

The game is also modable, it probably won't be long until the first ones using the new systems come out (some mods for RtW2 are also being converted afaik).

Overall:
Rule the Waves 3 is a great game with a great community. It surely isn't for everyone but if you like these kind of games definitely give it a shot!",1
138591631,1268750,"Definitely rough around the edges and worthwhile of being in early access, but this game is some welcome dumb fun.

138678122,1451810,"I love LEGO, I love all sorts of racing games, and have played thousands of hours of them. However, for LEGO 2K DRIVE, 2K tried to take both roads with the pricing model and ended up turning a lot of people away. You either make a game that's $60 with **NO** MICROTRANSACTIONS, or you make a game free-to-play with microtransactions that are cosmetic at most. As they say, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

The game itself is a true blast, it's got a lot going for it. It's like a mix between Forza Horizon and The Crew 2's open world, with the Lego Racers aesthetic, aimed at a younger demographic. The game's story is quite fun for me so far and its car editor/builder is a huge time-waster that works surprisingly well on a controller. It's got a good open world that's fun to explore, it's not as big as I expected it would be but it's big enough to be worthwhile to just drive around in finding collectibles and destroying everything. The big thing holding that aspect back is that they developed this for last-gen consoles (notably Switch) so instead of it being a true, seamless open-world, it's five worlds that are each an area/biome. That's fine, but it makes me wonder what that aspect of the game could've been if it were a seamless open world.

However, for a game aimed at kids, the microtransactions & in-game shop in this game are quite predatory. It takes quite some time to be able to buy ONE vehicle, and honestly you should be able to buy your first microtransaction vehicle by a couple of hours into the game, not take about 20 hours to get a ton of BrikBux before buying your first vehicle. The grind itself doesn't bother me personally, I play a lot of games with it. However, the intention of 2K and Visual Concepts is to make you get frustrated enough while playing the game to just give in and spend more money on a car instead of spending time unlocking it. That is by design, especially as this game is built for and marketed towards children, who naturally have less patience than adults.

In conclusion, the gameplay itself is fun but the business model from 2K and Visual Concepts is not. I'd say I expected better, but in 2023 that would be a lie. It hurts me to not recommend this title because the core gameplay is there, but I cannot in good faith recommend it because of the way its business model preys on children. If you want to buy it, wait until it is on a deep sale, which will probably be pretty quick based on what I have seen of previous 2K first-party titles. At the same time, only buy it and go in knowing that you will be spammed by menus asking you to buy microtransactions, so avoid them at all costs.

PARENTS: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR YOUR KIDS. However, if you feel so strongly that you have to, PLEASE stay in the room with them and supervise them while playing it. THIS GAME'S IN-GAME STORE IS AIMED AT CHILDREN, and they WILL fall for it if they are not careful. I hate that I have to say something like this for a video game, especially one based off of such a fun pastime such as LEGOs, but 2K has forced my hand to have to say something like this.",0

Oh boy, oh boy, let me tell you about Dungeon Village 2! It's like a wild rollercoaster ride, except instead of loops and drops, you get goblins and ice cream. I mean, who needs gravity-defying thrills when you can have a dairy empire, am I right?

The game starts innocently enough, with your humble little village nestled in a picturesque valley. But don't let the tranquility fool you! Before you know it, you're knee-deep in goblins, and your cows are demanding better pastures. Who knew bovine divas could be so demanding?

To succeed in Dungeon Village 2, you must master the fine art of multitasking. One moment, you're managing your goblin-slaying heroes, sending them off to fight tooth and nail against some grumpy green critters. The next, you're off to churn ice cream like your life depends on it. Who said being a dairy lord was easy?

And speaking of ice cream, let me just say, this game takes its frozen treats seriously. From your classic vanilla to the mind-boggling goblin surprise flavor (no goblins were harmed in the making, I promise), you'll have more flavors than you can shake a sword at. It's like a lactose-intolerant person's worst nightmare and a dairy lover's dream come true, all rolled into one.

The graphics? Stunning! The goblins are so detailed that you can practically smell their questionable hygiene, and the cows...oh, the cows! They're the true stars of the show. They moo with such gusto, you'd think they were auditioning for a bovine opera. 10/10 would pet those virtual udders again.

Now, I won't lie, there were a few hiccups in my milk-fueled journey. Sometimes the goblins would glitch out and start tap dancing, and once my ice cream shop caught fire because the game ""accidentally"" added ghost chili peppers to the recipe. But hey, who doesn't enjoy a little chaos with their dairy empire, right?

In conclusion, Dungeon Village 2 is a delightful mix of fantasy, farming, and frosty treats. It's like the love child of a fantasy novel and a Ben & Jerry's ice cream parlor. If you're looking for a game that will have you slaying goblins one minute and churning ice cream the next, all while keeping your dairy-loving heart content, this is the game for you. Embrace your inner dairy lord and prepare for the adventure of a lifetime!

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a goblin-infested ice cream parlor to tend to. And remember, always carry a sword in one hand and a scoop in the other. You never know when the goblins might demand an extra scoop of strawberry!

Disclaimer: The author of this review is not responsible for any sudden cravings for ice cream or an uncontrollable urge to milk cows. Play at your own lactose-tolerant risk!",1

138591284,2369390,"Consider Far cry franchise is something tangible like wine, this one is the most full-body and outstanding flavor but with one dimensional palate and terribly short aftertaste.
.
The story is interesting as Far Cry Standard but worn out really quickly after you complete only the ""FIRST"" act that you choose, you will know what you're doing next, Shooting, experience some cringey dialogs, hope something to be better aaaand more shooting......your feeling of careless to follow the story is growing stronger and without you know it, you press uninstall to get your mighty 170GB back and call back for something better like Red Dead 2.
.
Map in this game is so vast and have a lot of things to do, you will dump like 10 hours or more in a bit enjoying the scenery, fighting Federal officers, helping imprisoned resistance, finding secret, and many more!!! but after that......Again the feeling of careless is growing, the storytelling is heavily affected to the presentation of the game that you will ask yourself, Why do I bother playing for more of emptiness?
.
This is the very first Far Cry that has so many enemy type, the game will indirectly tells you how to defeat enemy in each type. The poison enemy? douse it with fire, enemy with armor and helmet? kill them with armor-piercing rounds, vehicles and helicopters? shot them down with Blast ammo or use emps. you will doing this for like several hours and realize that Headshot enemy with Armor-Piercing can kill every enemy in a matter of seconds, so why bother wasted like 5 rounds of fire ammo and wait for the explosion. The vehicle in this game is so weak compare to other previous game, it takes a  Blast mag of AR to be ready to explode, so why bother use EMP,  because you even can  call your upgraded vehicle anytime you 're at the road, they're tanky, can refill your ammo. I don't want to extent how genius the AI in this game, they are just lackluster and stop following you after fleeing with cars, NPCs are just there for revive you up in the hard difficulty.

Firmament is awesome, or maybe more awesome-ish. The first patch arriving yesterday fixed some more or less critical issues - like one npc not talking to you. 

Graphics are great - I get solid 90 fps using Index res 250%, all epic graphics settings, but shadows do not work and need to be set to ""low"". I'm using DLSS Quality and have set antialiasing to ""medium"", can't see any difference between medium and high or epic antialiasing when using res 250%.

No. Bugs bugs bugs and bugs. And then there are game breaking bugs.
Narration was completely missing on launch, a days later they had a ""almost fixed it"" patch. Why? Was it to bothersome to TEST the game before the publish button was eagerly pressed?
Falling through ""elevators"", ""moving objects"" is the norm. (Hello, QA?)
Short. You can finish this game in ~3 hours +/- depending on you mileage. IF the bugs let you do the puzzles as they are supposed to be solved. (Main puzzle objects (a notoriously buggy Crane)gets stuck in terrain or ""invisible  walls"", and only solution is to ""Teleport to Safety"" or plain simply exit the game and reload). (Teleport to Safety under Settings (WHY?) menu, will as it implies get you out of a stuck situation, what is not mentioned is it will also reset the puzzle to precious state, not necessary fully reset (thank the bitlord)

Is it all negative? No. The game looks pretty nice, runs fairly ok (I have not noticed any pref. issues, but also my setup is high end), but reading comments it not many complaints, bedside the VR issues. This game do not function properly in VR.

Puzzles is ok i guess, pretty average if you expect Myst'ish puzzles. Not even in the same universe. But that want say they are easy, mostly for stupid mechanics, illogical, and outright annoying since most of the time you got no clue what you are supposed to do or even how (i guess that's where the Myst part comes in).
I dont mind puzzles where part of the puzzle is figuring out how it work and how to go around starting to solve it, but at least make it consistent. Like you are connecting ""valves, but cant connect vales that are in perfect alignment with each other, oh no, you have to find the obscure ones hidden behind environments and around corners because screw you player. Or connecting something in a very specific order, without any hint what so ever what that might be.

I  want say, do not buy this game. 
Over all it is a pretty good game, but Not in its current state. Wait fort some major patches.",0
138675944,754890,"Current recommendation: Buy on sale or skip.

This game is not worth your time currently. Not even for a sale.
The few and short vistas you visit are looking nice, but are constantly diminished by poorly optimized graphics, noisy particle effects and a lot of things feel slightly off. The story, world themes and backstory is nothing to brag home about.
I hoped the game was much more, but sadly it wasn't.

Please, do your own research, but at the time of writing this is a janky fest of tireless game mechanics based on poorly optimized physics puzzles.

[h2]Puzzles & Mechanics[/h2]
The variety of puzzles is mostly meager, there is - if you had tighter controls on the game - probably 2-3 hours of puzzle content here. All of the puzzles I've encountered have user feeedback issues and end in guesstimating the controls while hoping that you've fiddled with it just right.

Reminding you, this game has been 4-5 years in development at this point and I'm not exaggerating when saying that this game broke every mechanic it had.
[list]
[*] The options greet you with a very visible option to ""Teleport to a safe location"", which already had me wondering
[*] The game got multiple times stuck in movement
[*] The narrator is apparently getting stuck within the first 15 minutes in your game. If you're lucky, restarting the game or starting a new playthrough may help.
[*] The first puzzle you encounter can be easily broken on the first interaction you have with it.
[*] There's a two-point crane puzzle that has you do relatively mundane puzzle stuff, that gets constantly blocked. This crane alone broke so many times on me in different ways, that it could need its own review alone.
[*] The games credits roll, the first person needle is stuck on screen. The main menu shows - and it's locked up. All that can be done is forcing the game to quit. What a fitting ending to a janky game.
[/list]

There are not a lot of puzzles and some of them fall either in the category of intentionally misleading or straight up annoying. There's a connection based puzzle that has intentional markers that has nothing to do with the solution. The markings are put very prominently in the view of the player.
Another group of puzzles require you to put on a suit. The primary suit puzzle has one specific segment, where it presents you with the problem of having indestructible obstacles, but for some reason your left-handed tool can just reach through it. This is an area where the game suddenly restricts your view more akin to a 4:3 view, which gets disorienting fast. This is worsened by the puzzle design, that requires you to get a good understanding of the place and look into any direction, particularly top and bottom.
I found that really most puzzles suffer from being unable to observe the puzzle state and hard to see the important aspects of it, leaving most of it to guessing and hoping it's fitting without forming a mental model of the puzzle or solution.
Lastly, I've missed the part where your primary interaction gets upgrades. The following section is primarily aimed at the developer and hidden due to its spoilery nature:
[spoiler]
So, the hand armament needs an upgrade and you walk down this lavish hall. There's a door with an interaction point, which rushes you deeper within to open the shutters. Just behind you is the augmentation device - that you need to continue the game. I've missed the part to insert anything into it, as it gave no indication that the tool needs to be placed within. This was supported by the fact that the opening animation needed to be finished before the tool inserts itself if you're standing just close enough.
So, let me picture an alternative solution:
You walk down the stairs, the augmentation device greets you. The player walks around it and it presents itself, staying open once you've looked at it. There's no door, there's no shortcut. You need to eventually place the device to continue - on which the elevator descends, you're presented the augmentation puzzle and two doors open. One with the shutters, one with the shortcut, preventing players to miss this important upgrade to the game.
It does not help, that you have to play the game for quite some time before getting these locked upgrades, but presented to you within the first minute of the game is a book detailing these things.

[h2]Graphics[/h2]
As previously mentioned, the vistas do look nice. It looks most of the time good, however I always felt that the central location could be much more pompous. Most of the fidelity issues could likely be solved by more traditional approaches, for example static lighting and shadow maps for all the static scenery.
Performance is alright, but even my system was lightly sweating with medium-to-high graphical settings. If you can, focus initially on having post-processing as high as possible, as the first scene otherwise looks atrocious. 

[h2]Story[/h2]
I'd say that the story is on the surface alright, the premise of it is even good. The presentation is done via a narrator/companion that constantly talks to you. The takeaway is that it's alright, but obtuse.
Following are [i]heavy[/i] story spoilers.
[spoiler]
Please, if you intend to play the game, do not keep reading this spoiler.
- One thing that constantly bugged me is that the companion reminds you often that she cannot interact with you or see anything, but reacts to every interaction you have on the world. This could be somewhat explained by the ending, but the background lore doesn't give enough way to allow for that.
- The narrator explains in the end, that she forced you to learn other characters names and their lives - as the game keeps you intentionally obtuse of what it used to be to live in the Firmament and you see the Keepers names once for a brief moment. It never forms a connection or contextualizes prior Keepers and their ways except in one point.
- The ending reveals that the primary character which broke the Firmament won the role by lottery and is well known to be mentally unfit for that position. Why that person still was chosen is never explained and causes the story to be entirely pointless.

If Cyan released a game per year or every 2 years, this would be a good entry: we wouldn't have to wait too long for the next game and this would satisfy.

getting ingame cash is a bit slow i will admit, but play the story mode and you'll end up with 10k before you know it. Not to mention the humor. lmao.

So why the negative review?

To sum it up, 2K's executives have decided to prey on children - this games monetisation is extremely toxic & should not be legal. It is by design made to siphon money from you and wear down at your mental health all in the name of profit. This is a scam dressed up as a game.

The monetization practices are at best predatory, and at worse abusive. This is a full-price game, the full version costing £104 . The executives that manhandled this game to be somehow more predatory than EA need to be fired & removed. Do not support this game anymore than you already have, if you've bought it and can't refund, do NOT give in to the microtransations, they will take advantage of you if you are not able to resist temptations. It is designed meticulously in a way to appeal to impulses.

I keep using the word ""predatory"", and thats for good reason. This is a game marketed towards children, and its built around a microtransation system that hides & obfuscated information. You do not see the price of the coins anywhere in the game, preying on children whose parents aren't tech-savvy enough to have parental locks on steam. They will make purchases outside their means, and that is BY DESIGN. The obfuscation of the price of coins means that ANY CHILD will just pick the biggest number not realising that what they are doing is making a purchase. I was a kid once, I know damn well that 13 year old me would not have been aware enough to stop before making a purchase. Once that ""buy"" screen is up, its over, that child will put down any information they could to get that skin they want.

It is so extremely predatory it should be on a list..

The progression after completing 1/3rd of the game with time spent searching for collectables is BY DESIGN made to frustrate you into getting those coins to get the currency used in the game. After 6 hours I do not have enough of said currency to buy *ONE* vehicle, so you are either forced to pay up more on a full priced game, or spend the next week of your life wittling away at getting a SINGLE VEHICLE. And keep in mind, I did the game at the designed pace, the story is 18 hours, I did a third of it in 6 - you cannot buy one thing in the shop with 1/3 of the games length and thats unacceptable.

That is not even beginning to mention the mental games it starts to play with you right from the beginning, it toys with you at the beginning trying to make these ""cool items"" seem easy to get. The game constantly shoves advertising for its in-game shop, slowly wearing you down until you go ""fine, i'll take a look"" just to shut the character up. It is made this way to annoy you enough, to overwhelm you enough, to break through any fortifications you've built up to get you to give in. Everything about this game is designed to push you into that shop. It locks what could be a very good vehicle creator behind tons of gates & hidden stuff because they want you to be frustrated, you don't have every brick you would need right away, you don't have every vehicle base you would need to make something you want to. You can't even make a completely custom vehicle despite the game very much having the capability to do so.

This is the game that defines the state that gaming has become, its no longer about making a good game - now its about taking as much money as possible. Do. Not. Buy.

138499843,2304600,"TL;DR Below.

Stack Masters is an addictive and delightful game that offers hours of entertainment and challenges for players of all ages. Having had the privilege of playing it before its release, I can confidently say that it delivers a truly enjoyable gaming experience.

The game revolves around stacking blocks, creating towering structures, and reaching the goal zone. With each level, you'll find yourself facing new challenges that require a careful balance of strategy and skill. The physics mechanics add an extra layer of complexity, making every move count and every tower construction a puzzle to be solved.

One aspect that sets Stack Masters apart is its competitive element. The game not only provides a relaxing and zen-like atmosphere to unwind but also encourages friendly competition among friends. The inclusion of leaderboards creates a healthy rivalry, as you strive to outperform your friends and achieve the highest scores possible. It adds an extra level of motivation and replay value to the game.

I particularly enjoyed the variety of levels and themes that Stack Masters offers. Each level feels unique and presents its own set of physics-based obstacles to overcome. Whether you're a casual player seeking a calming experience or a hardcore gamer looking for a true challenge, Stack Masters caters to both ends of the spectrum. It strikes a perfect balance between relaxation and a satisfying brain-teaser.

The game's visuals and sound design deserve commendation as well. The graphics are visually appealing, and the attention to detail is evident throughout. Combined with the soothing music, the overall aesthetic creates a truly immersive and enjoyable experience.

While Stack Masters is developed by a single developer, it impressively showcases a high level of quality and polish. The dedication and passion of the developer are clearly evident in the game's mechanics, art, and overall presentation.

On a personal side of things, my 12 and 10 year old have played this game and have thoroughly enjoyed the building aspect. My 12 year old has Tourettes and ADHD, and in his words ""this game does something that makes my brain feel better"". My 10 year old loves the Level Editor, where he can, in his words, ""make hard levels that my brother can't beat!"".

In conclusion, Stack Masters is a fantastic addition to any gaming library. Its addictive gameplay, wide variety of levels, competitive element, and overall charm make it a standout title. Whether you're seeking a relaxing challenge or a thrilling competition with friends, Stack Masters delivers on both fronts. With its addictive nature, Stack Masters has the potential to keep you entertained for hours on end.


>> TL;DR <<
-Developed by a single developer, showcasing dedication and passion.
-Block building... need I say more.
-Space graphics. 
-Relaxing music.
-Compete against your friends.
-Challenging puzzles.
-You can make your own levels.
-A fantastic addition to any gaming library.

Also some effects like the fog you can see on the mountains seem to have an incorrect Z value, and they appear as if they're right in front of you when in reality they should be far away.

The game has multiple biomes per run that each have on average 1-2 spaces that allow for permanent skill unlocks for your characters. There are also candles you can collect which unlocks the essentials for Darkest Dungeon (trinkets, combat items) as well as character backgrounds which allow for up to three unique ways to play a different character.

The queue times were short, the game looks very beautiful, the movement and ""finisher"" ideas are cool too. I didn't play it enough to have an opinion about the zones or specific weapons yet, so I can't say if it's good or bad. Tbh I didn't have the feeling like ""ooh I need to play more of this!"" like I had in Valorant after playing a few of my first rounds. I never played cod or battle royale games, so some mechanics are a bit new to me. I had a hard time to understand the basics and what is going on in the match (like what to do when you get out of bullets in the mode vs Ais? Didn't see any weapons on the floor. Which modifiers to use  for the weapons etc) but if I would actually plan to play it, I guess I could figure everything out by watching some guides. I still got some kills:D
Not to forget I experienced a bug that I couldn't move my vision for some time and got killed cause of that. But that's ok in early access it only happened once and didn't bother me. The game doesn't feel that clunky I feel like it's fluent. If they add something, that makes it feel more ""catchy"" and more tension in the gameplay I think it would get me hooked. As I said for free to play always worth a shot and deserves a fair chance. Maybe they won't be as geeedy as other companies:)",1

138529252,1304930,"Outlast Trials is a great game, but it also has some flaws that prevent it from reaching its full potential. Here are some of the aspects that I think could be improved:

- The game is not as frightening as the previous Outlast games. The atmosphere and the jump scares are not as effective in creating a sense of dread and horror.
- The enemies appearances are not as scary as they could be
- The player has to hold an equipment with his hand all the time, which is annoying and distracting. and it also blocks the view of the screen.
- The player gets tired very easily, which makes the game more frustrating than challenging. The stamina system is too restrictive and unrealistic, and it does not add much to the gameplay or the immersion.
- The night vision mode should make the enemies look more scary, especially their eyes, In the previous Outlast games, the night vision mode enhanced the horror by making the enemies look more demonic and terrifying. In this game, however, the night vision mode does not have much effect on the appearance of the enemies, and it does not create a contrast between light and darkness.
- The chasing soundtrack is not as scary as it should be.

Overall, I give Outlast Trials a 6.5 out of 10. It is still one of the best games of this year, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys horror games. However, I also think that it could have been better if it had addressed some of the issues that I mentioned above.",1

Where are the chaos filled PvP matches?
Why are all storyboards clearly made from an AI tool? Even the announcers feel like they were made with Ai. Strange breathing in between lines/words.
Why can you literally buy upgrades and mechs within the store?!
What the hell is up with the UI configuration? why is it not just a normal esc menu compared to whatever we got?
The story isn't even the same, a complete Overhall. (Hawken got it's name from the Hawken virus, this game scraps it and uses nanites and recons a lot about the original setting)

138679147,1304930,"The Outlast Trials for an early access game it's great and me and my friend haven't met any game breaking bugs. There was just one time a guy chasing us got stuck in the ground and he couldn't move. In the Early Access there's 3 trials with various challenges after completing the main objective. It's nice because it adds some additional content to kill time in and it's honestly quite fun. It's very well optimized for how great it looks graphicaly and cannot complain about anything really. Some people may think that 29€ is a bit much for a Indie game but it's worth every penny. I'm not rlly great at writing reviews because I'm not a reviewer but I recommend this game. It's a 9,5/10. Excluding 0,5 points because it feels a bit grindy and repetitive after like 10hours of gameplay. It makes sense since it's just an early access and there's more trials to come which I'm personally excited for! What would help this game a lot is if the community could make their own trials and share them on the workshop. This feature could be added after they finished telling the lore of TOT and simply finished with the game's storyline. So players after finishing the entire game would just hop on a playermade trial. To summarize my bad review (because I can't make reviews). It's a great horror game that's scary alone and fun with friends. Content for early access is enough, the optimization is great, graphics beautiful and gory (as always in the Outlast series, the DEVS aren't afraid of overusing Nudity and Sexuality in a gory way), Nothing else to add other than that it's worth the prize rn.",1

If you're ok with grinding or spending money on a game you already paid premium full price for, by all means this game is for you. If you have enough creativity to work with a limited parts pallette out of the gate, you can have plenty of fun with this game without grinding for even a moment. If you want to just play the story mode, sure, go for it! But I can't in good conscience say ""This is a game for everybody and should be given praise for everything it does right"" because the one thing it does wrong it does to an egregious extent, and will likely only get worse over time.

Overall, it's a fun game marred eternally by Microtransactions and a pretty apparent lack of single player content (which the game expects you to grind pretty endlessly to buy the items in the shop since multiplayer races are worth a fraction of the payout).

There are tons of starter bricks and a bit of flair (stickers) to create a vehicle with. Of course, there are things to buy with real money and a ""battle pass"" (season pass). But, the season pass isn't open yet so I couldn't see what was in it. The in game currency to buy those things is floating around the world and is also given to you at a decent rate. Only playing the actual game for about 30 minutes I had already amassed about $1000... Lego bucks or whatever they call them, without trying. 

It shows promise. Driving feels good. Races are fun and chaotic. Vehicle transitions are smooth. Haven't run into any bugs yet. I was able to make a vehicle the way I wanted without having to comprise due to brick availability restraints. There is a brick limit on vehicles, but I went a little crazy and still finished mine almost at the limit. Again, without compromise.

Won my first multiplayer online race on Xbox which paid out 5 brickbux. Some of the cars cost around 10,000 brickbux. I estimate with loading a new match, filling lobbies, and finishing the race at a generous 5 minutes per race.

This means you'd need to win (not just complete) 2000 races, which at 5 minutes per race you'll complete in about 167 hours to get that 10k DLC car.

Needless to say I refunded the game. I can't imagine how anyone can find this anything but predatory.

I understand you get decent payouts for single player events, but that's only on the first time you complete the event. Payouts for subsequent completions of the same event are far less.

Also, no cross-progression.  I started out on Xbox and thought PC might be more enjoyable with small sessions on the Steam Deck.  This means you'd need to buy battlepass, all DLC, and complete all the content again.

TSUNDERE MILFIN is a Puzzle/Dating Sim developed by CUTE ANIME GIRLS.

[h1] Gameplay / Story [/h1]

Read on if you like scantily clad women: Similar to the real four-in-a-row, this game is all about sliding to form pairs of three in a vertical or horizontal row. These then dissolve and other characters slide after them. Different symbols (food like donuts) have to be resolved. The more you combine at once, the more opportunities you have to get a bonus. As an example, you get multiple bonuses that dissolve multiple stones at once. Your goal is to resolve a certain number of the respective symbols in order to complete the respective level, to invest the points you have earned in the company, to make the woman in your life happy and to win her heart. A help function has also made it into the game, which points you in the right direction. The whole game is accompanied by relaxed music in the background and women in sexy costumes with animations.

[h1] Information / Review Deutsch [/h1]

TSUNDERE MILFINist ein Puzzlespiel/Dating Sim, welches von CUTE ANIME GIRLS entwickelt wurde.

[h1] Gameplay / Geschichte [/h1]

Lies weiter, wenn du leicht bekleidete Frauen magst: Ähnlich wie früher beim realen Vier-Gewinnt geht es bei diesem Spielchen darum, durch verschieben gleiche Dreierpärchen in vertikaler oder horizontaler Reihe zu bilden. Diese lösen sich dann auf und andere Zeichen rutschen nach. Es gilt verschiedene Symbole (Lebensmittel wie Donuts) aufzulösen. So mehr du auf einmal Kombinierst, desto mehr Möglichkeiten hast du, an einen Bonus ran zu kommen. Als Beispiel bekommst du mehrere Boni, die mehrere Steine auf einmal auf lösen. Dein Ziel ist es eine gewisse Anzahl der jeweiligen Symbole aufzulösen, um das jeweilige Level abzuschließen, um deine verdiente Punkte in die Firma zu investieren, um die Frau deines Lebens eine Freude zu bereiten und deren Herz zu gewinnen. Eine Hilfefunktion hat es auch in das Spiel geschafft, die dich in die richtige Richtung deutet. Begleitet wird das ganze Spiel durch einen entspannte Musikuntermalung im Hintergrund und Frauen in sexy Kostümen mit Animationen. 

[h1] Pro [/h1]

+ für Erwachsene
+ Dating mal anders
+ Charme ist vorhanden
+ schöne Menüführung
+ klassisches Spielprinzip, dass aber einige Neuerungen mit sich bringt
+ sexy Kostüme
+ schöner Grafikstil
+ entspannende Musikstücke
+ Animation in den Puzzle
+ viele Einstellungsmöglichkeiten
+ gutes Preis/Leistungsverhältnis 

[h1] Kontra [/h1]

- keine Herausforderung
- kurze Spielzeit

[h1] Fazit [/h1]

TSUNDERE MILFIN bietet dir ein entspanntes Spiel für Zwischendurch, welches dich zum entspannen und knobeln zugleich einlädt. Auch wird das Spielprinzip in die Tat umgesetzt. Dank der einfachen Regeln und des hohen Unterhaltungsfaktors machen dieses Spiel besonders. Egal ob für mehrere Stunden oder nur ein paar Minuten.

Imagine Original DD (The REAL ONE), when you can only choose 4 recruits, they always are the same and you are allowed to visit only one very hard room. Again, agai, again.. ane again

I dont recommend this game at all and I wish I could get a refund",0
138528506,1940340,"I really like the game! it is not perfect but it is very good, and it takes some serious balls to not repeat the same formula that brought them success in the first one, instead they have incorporated some of the aspects of DD1 and aspects of other genres to make a NEW game, this is not meant to be Darkest Dungeon 1.5 this is a different type of game, it is very important old fans understand that.

TLDR: game overall is great. Combat, heroes, enemies and meta progression are good, however expect to start noticing a lack of variation with your runs and expect to have expend significant time to complete said runs. (1.5-2.5 hours to complete a run)  

Positives:
- Art direction
- Combat
- Animations 
- Hero paths (this is a like choosing the specialisation of your hero, sometimes it will allow for a different play style to mix things up)
- Return of some of our loved old heroes 
- interesting items to use in and out of combat 
- narrator + backstories being implemented on this game for our heroes 
- enemy design 
- the game can be tough at times but you have a easy mode accessible right from the beginning and the easy mode gets easier if you are having a difficult time. Accessibility is always a plus in my book, not everyone wants a no light/torchless hardcore experience 
- Freedom to experiment without too many repercussions (aside from time) : due  to characters not being permanently dead (you get them again next run if you want), you are free to experiment and challenge some tough encounters, touch suspicious altars, etc. The worst it can happen is a team wipe but at least you got to experience something new hopefully! 

Negatives:
- Runs are lengthy and can feel similar* This represents 80% of the negatives for me, more on this later
- We have the hero paths but we are definitely lacking some characters, variation can feel a little weak sometimes, I find myself relying on 1-2 heroes to fill certain roles which hurts play style variation at times, full disclaimer that I haven't had experimental runs so far (melee vestal, front line occultist, all support comp, etc)
- Progression can feel slow at times (specially if you are not familiar with the game), if you are having a tough time you will not get a lot of meta progression, my suggestion is to grab the easy mode if you need it. 


* RUN LENGTH: by far the biggest complain I have with the game the runs can feel very slow, full disclaimer that I have not beaten the game, I am on the third boss so there are at least 2 chapters I have not explored just yet however what I have seen so far is that >90% of the run itself is very similar from one to another, the main choices that will affect the run will happen right at the beginning when you take your initial heroes and spend some points to unlock meta progression items (you get these items for your next run for free), after you take these decisions there is little variation on the run, so the next big change happens right at the end when you see the last boss of the chapter.

This has a few sub issues:
- Bosses are hard on this game (just like DD1 I guess), the problem is not that the boss is hard, the problem is that to challenge it again you need to go through a 2 hour grind that is very similar to the grind you just experienced, specially if you are already aware of the gimmick of the boss which will force you into a similar team comp in order to full fill the gimmick 
- There is pretty much no way to speed up the run, if you start avoiding encounters you heroes will be under prepared so it actually makes sense to take tougher, lengthier encounters (think elites in StS) to better prepare your heroes for the challenge (and oh boy the bosses are a challenge) 
- If you are unlucky and you lose a vital hero right at the end of the run, then you have to start all over again, there is almost no way that a random hero you would get at the last checkpoint will be able to correctly full fill the role of the hero you just lost and thus here come another 2 hours of the same grind.


I hope this feedback goes to the devs, I absolutely still recommend this game with my eyes closed, this is an excellent game and there are so many amazing enemies, encounters, etc that will bring you a lot of joy, however I might not find myself sinking 300 hours like I did in DD1 unfortunately (even though on paper this is the roguelike type of game that would supposedly encourage infinite replay ability)

138504288,1304930,fixed a lot of beta problems. fun game,1
138504285,1304930,Red barrels never miss on any game they've made. I'm getting Manhunt/Saw vibes from this game and I fucking love it. The game is genuinely terrifying and you're constantly on edge. Can't recommend it enough if you have the balls to play it.,1
138504305,1304930,"Played one game and got spooked, jumped and grossed out more than any horror experience has given me in its entirety. 10/10 would run past man with car battery attached to his nuts again.",1

138679867,1304930,This game is bussin because of how scary it is and it's kinda hard at the start and just look at the menu screen and theme,1
138679929,1304930,"Joined a game, had no directions with what to do, other people were running around doing stuff using weapons while I'm just getting killed with no way to defend myself. Runs great and the graphics are good but for a first time player there is nothing to tell you what to do. Didn't take long to realise this isn't for me",0
